# The inventory's auto-stack moves, a few at a time.
#
# The button (uiinventory.py, __OnAutoStackButton) sends a move for every pair
# of stacks of one item: 300 moves for 25 stacks, all in the frame it was
# clicked in. The server counts a character's packets per second and closes
# the connection at 300 (CInputMain::Analyze, logged as FLOOD_HEADER_13), which
# threw the player back to the login screen (l0st3k, 15 September). The same
# moves leave MOVES_PER_TICK every TICK seconds from here, sixty a second.
#
# Python 2.7 as the client has it.
