"""The playerbot migrator (mariadb/playerbot/apply.sh) for the mt2009 world.

Usage:  python migratorify.py

Copies linux-port/docker/mariadb/playerbot/{apply.sh,itemshop_schema.sql} into
linux-port-mt2009/docker/mariadb/playerbot/ and rewrites what the schema and
the map layout change:

  * the readiness probe: mt2009's log schema has hack_log, not speed_hack;
    player.item_proto is a view over world.item_proto (initdb creates it);
  * the list of maps a bot may be parked on: this stack's m2-render-config
    hosts the package's forty-six maps plus the guild villages and the high
    maps, so the list is that layout, not r40250's.

Idempotent: re-run after editing the r40250 original.

# not exist - so a fresh world ran at 100% whatever the panel's own table said.
# It said 650% experience, seeded into web_admin_rates by the panel's schema
# for a test cycle long ago, and that number reached every player as a promise
# the game never kept: the panel showed it, the bots levelled at 100%, and the

# real (NerrVoVy and Tieru, 20 September).

# So the numbers the launcher asked for are written here, into both places at

# panel is never touched again, whatever this file says. That is also why the
