"""Render each map's terrain into a small PNG the panel can use as a backdrop.

Not a screenshot of the game: this is drawn from the same server_attr the bots
navigate by, so what a viewer sees is exactly what the bots can walk on. Land,
water, blocked ground and crossings each get a colour, and the result is
downsampled to a tile small enough to embed in the panel source.

A crossing is water with the block bit cleared - a bridge deck, or a ford. It
matters enough to have its own colour and its own downsampling rule: Orc Valley
is twenty-three islands joined by twenty-two bridges, and a map drawn without
them shows a delta nobody could cross. The bot navigation reads the same
distinction out of the same file, so the backdrop and the routes agree.
