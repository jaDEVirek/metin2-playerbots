"""Package the running 1.24.9 installation as a distributable zip.

The installation is the operator's own live folder, so it carries things a
download must not: the passwords its database was built with, the path to the
client on their F: drive, the update backups the launcher keeps, and the logs.
Everything else is exactly what a player needs, which is why the package is
built from the installation rather than from the repository - the repository
does not carry the 550 MB of build context the first launch needs.
