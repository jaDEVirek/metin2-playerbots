"""The offline shop's "edit the price of similar items", one packet at a time.

Ctrl + right click repriced every line holding the same item and the client
sent one packet per line in a single frame; the server takes one shop action
per 200 ms, so the first line went through and every other one answered "wait
a moment". shoppricepump.py spaces them out.

Runs on the client's Python 2.7 and on 3:
