# include it), because this quest engine has no death event and its affect API
# cannot be shared with the movement-speed quest.
#
# Nothing is substituted into the file: the two bonus percentages are named
# constants in high_risk.h, not text in here, because they are read by the core
# and not by the quest.
#
# M2_HIGH_RISK=0 leaves it out. The core change is inert without it -- no
# character can set the flag, so every check falls through to stock behaviour --
# which is what makes the mode removable without rebuilding the source.
#
# THE CORE HALF USED TO BE MISSING HERE, AND THAT IS WORTH SPELLING OUT. For a
# while this block staged the quest and nothing else, while the comment above
# said the meaning was "compiled into the cores". It was -- but only on the one
# machine where files/high_risk/patch_core.py had been run by hand. Every server
# built from this repository got a quest that set a flag no code ever read: the
# offer appeared at level 15, the player chose High Risk, and absolutely nothing
# happened. No killer flag, so not attackable and not marked; no Cruel drop
# band; no bonuses. It looked like a broken feature rather than a missing one,
# which is exactly the kind of silence this project tries not to ship.
#
# So the C++ half is applied right here, against the tree that is about to be
# compiled, every time. --core-only keeps it off the repository: the quest above
# and the Dockerfile's qc stage are already in the checkout and must not be
# rewritten during a build.
