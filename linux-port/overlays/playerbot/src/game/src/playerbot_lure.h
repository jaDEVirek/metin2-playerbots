// The Archer's job in a party: bring the monsters to the people who can kill
// them.
//
// This replaces the occasional extra shot the Archer used to take mid-fight.
// That version tagged one distant monster, invented a damage number when the
// real one came out too low, and then went back to its own target - so nothing
// about it was a pull: the monster arrived at whoever happened to be nearest,
// or did not arrive at all, and nobody was waiting for it.
//
// A course is a whole errand, and it either delivers monsters or says why not:
//
//   WAIT_READY -> PLAN -> APPROACH -> TAG -> CONFIRM -> (APPROACH | RETURN)
//                 -> HANDOFF -> RECOVER -> WAIT_READY
//
// The three things this is built around, because each of them is how a luring
// bot goes wrong:
//
// - **A pull is what came back, not what was shot at.** CONFIRM counts the live
//   monsters actually chasing the Archer, so a miss, a monster killed by the
//   arrow, and a pack that never woke up all count as nothing. "Oddano strzal"
//   is not a metric.
// - **The party has to be standing there.** One lurer per party, and the
//   receivers are counted alive, on this map and around the gathering point -
//   with the Archer itself excluded from that test, because walking away is its
//   whole job and must not cancel its own course.
// - **Nothing here touches the engine's aggro.** No SetVictim on the monster,
//   no clearing of aggro tables: the receivers take the monsters over by
//   fighting them, the way a party does, and a handover may be partial.
//
// An implementation fragment in the sense playerbot_types.h describes: include
// it exactly once, after playerbot_targeting.h, whose pull-target finder,
// aggressor count and ordinary bow shot this reuses rather than growing second
// versions of.
