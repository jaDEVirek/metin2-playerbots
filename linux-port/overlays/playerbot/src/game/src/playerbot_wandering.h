// What a bot does on a hunting map when nothing is asking for its attention.
//
// This is the difference between a populated world and a car park full of
// idling characters, so it is deliberately not "walk to a random point": bots
// work a rotation of hotspots, spread out rather than stack, and keep moving
// through ground they have already cleared.
//
// An implementation fragment in the sense playerbot_types.h describes: it
// defines objects, relies on the engine headers playerbot_manager.cpp includes
// above it, and reopens the same anonymous namespace. Include it exactly once.

	// A hub is only worth walking to if the navigation can actually get there.
	//
	// Orc Valley taught this. Its entrance opens onto one island of a river
	// delta, and while the navigation refused water - which is to say, refused
	// the bridges - all twelve of its hand-picked hubs sat on the far side of a
	// crossing. A bot planned an impossible route, gave up after three tries,
	// advanced to the next hub and planned another impossible route, twelve
	// times, then round again: twelve bots on that one map produced 7812 of the
	// 8259 "unreachable" lines in a session and never reached a hunting ground.
	//
	// That map is whole again, but the check stays, and not only as a memorial:
	// the Monkey Dungeon really is chambered, with 7.5% of its walkable ground
	// reachable from where a bot comes in, and any map may be built that way.
	//
	// Asking first costs a component lookup; the alternative costs a full A*
	// that is guaranteed to fail.
