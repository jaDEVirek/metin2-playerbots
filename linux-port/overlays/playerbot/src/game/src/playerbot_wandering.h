// What a bot does on a hunting map when nothing is asking for its attention.
//
// This is the difference between a populated world and a car park full of
// idling characters, so it is deliberately not "walk to a random point": bots
// work a rotation of hotspots, spread out rather than stack, and keep moving
// through ground they have already cleared.
//
// An implementation fragment in the sense playerbot_types.h describes: it
// defines objects, relies on the engine headers playerbot_manager.cpp includes
// above it, and reopens the same anonymous namespace. Include it exactly once.

	// The hub for this bot, from a banded table, by what the population has
	// seen there. Level rules the band; a party hub needs a party of the
	// challenge size with this bot leading it; among what is left the richest
	// ground wins, its worth shared out among the bots already on it - except
	// that a leader's own party and guild are not a crowd, so a guild converges
	// on one camp instead of fleeing each other. Unknown ground is scored as an
	// average spot, which is optimistic on purpose: it has to be looked at to
	// be known. A small hash keeps equal scores from all resolving the same way.
