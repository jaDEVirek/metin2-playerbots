// Live tuning: the weights an operator moves in the panel while the world runs.
//
// Every number a bot decides with used to be a constant, which meant that
// changing "fewer anglers, more metin hunters" cost a rebuild of the game image
// and a restart of the world - a quarter of an hour to answer a question that
// takes a minute to ask. These weights are read from a file instead, so the
// answer takes effect on the next planning tick.
//
// The file is a two-column TSV the panel writes into the rate spool, which is
// the one directory the panel and the game container share. Its format is the
// operator's, not ours: a name, a tab, a number, and anything after # ignored.
//
//     RESTOCK	100
//     METIN	140      # more metin hunters than usual
//
// 100 is neutral and is what every weight is worth when the file is missing,
// unreadable, or says nothing about it. That is deliberate: a fresh install and
// a broken file must both behave exactly like the build did before this
// existed. The range is 25 to 250 - a quarter as often, to two and a half times
// as often - and anything outside it is clamped rather than rejected, because a
// slider that silently does nothing is worse than one that stops at its end.

// The Moonlight chest event lives in the engine (patch 0006): thousandths of
// a chance per kill and per Metin stone, read from CONFIG at start. The panel
// moves them here through the same file as the weights, so the operator does
// not edit .env and restart to see more chests.
