"""The nicknames the bots wear, and the SQL that hands them out.

"Pozdrawiam pana botarek7 jest kotem ale brzmi jak bot" - kiciamol, and
jaroszv2 right after: "najgorzej jak biegasz wsrod botow i szukasz tego jednego
nicku a zlewaja sie wszystkie z tymi numerkami". A world of botX7 reads as a
world of bots however well they behave.

The pool is one list, written by a person: Iwakura's, from screenshots of the
Polish servers of 2010-2012 (11 September 2026, "tu jest postaranie"). The
earlier pool - jaksiezabic's list, the first Iwakura list and the names
composed from their words - is gone, and so is the class-and-sex pairing:
Tieru asked for the list as written, for everybody, and for every bot named
from the old pool to be renamed from this one ("te wszystkie stare nicki z
bazy powinny zostac wywalone, ta lista powinna byc aktywna").

Since 2.0.10 the list is dealt out by kingdom, the way Iwakura asked when the
1500-name list arrived ("przypisz po 500 losowych nickow na krolestwo, a
potem, jesli gracz ma wiecej niz 500 botow w danym krolestwie, do obecnych
nickow dopisuj 2, v2, 3 lub v3"): the list is shuffled once - by a seed
derived from its own content, so a regeneration deals the same hand - and
cut into three equal shares, one per kingdom. A kingdom whose cohort is
larger than its share (Chunjo's 1500 seeded identities) continues with its
own names and a "2" or "v2" behind them, then "3"/"v3", then v4 and so on
from the whole list. Before this the pool ran Chunjo first, in list order,
so Chunjo took the first thousand names and Shinsoo and Jinno were named
from the v2/v3 rounds while a third of the list stood idle.

Names are handed out by PID within a kingdom, to the bots that have none from
the pool yet. A bot that has one keeps it, whatever becomes of the list: until
19 September a changed list was a new pool version and every bot named from an
older one was renamed on the next start, which was right the one time the whole
world was to be renamed and wrong for every list after it - Iwakura's list of
19 September adds three hundred names and drops nine, and the operator's word
was to keep the names the bots already wear ("staraj sie nickow juz
istniejacych playerbotow nie podmienic", Tieru). So a list only ever names the
bots that come after it: a new world, a grown cohort, a bot that still wears
its seed name. A name dropped from the list stays on the bot that wears it;
the pool version is still written to common.playerbot_name_history, which is
how to tell which list a name came from.

Nothing about renaming is dangerous, and it is worth writing down why:
CPlayerBotManager::LoadRegisteredBots accepts a character by its account login
(playerbot_NNN), its social id and its player_index row, and never looks at the
name; both panels ask the account too; and generate_seed.py treats a renamed
character as still the character the registry describes as long as
common.playerbot_name_history agrees. So the name is the one part of a bot's
identity nothing depends on.
