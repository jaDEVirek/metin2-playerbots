# Changelog

Every release of this project, newest first. The admin panel reads this file to
show you what an update would bring before you install it.

Versions are `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`:

- **PATCH** — a fix. Nothing you do changes.
- **MINOR** — something new, or something behaves better than it did. Safe to
  take; nothing you have set up stops working.
- **MAJOR** — something you have to act on. A setting that has to move, a
  command that no longer exists, a manual step during the update. These say so
  at the top, in full, before anything else.

Updating never touches your database. Characters, accounts and settings survive
every version here.

## 1.17.0 — 2026-08-25

### Added

- **Autonomous Chunjo multi-map progression.** Bots now travel between Joan (M1), Bokjung (M2), Waryong (M3) and the Easy Monkey Dungeon through the real portals and local dungeon teleports. M1 remains the natural early zone, most level 20–35 characters move into M2, and a suitably equipped cohort visits M3.
- **A real Horse Medal journey.** Eligible bots enter the Easy Monkey Dungeon, navigate its disconnected rooms through the native GOTO portal graph, pick up actual Medal drops and deliver them to a Stable Boy. The M2 Stable Boy is used after a dungeon trip, avoiding the old M2 → M1 detour. Different bots deliberately farm a stock of one to three medals before leaving, with a bounded visit time.
- **Mounted travel.** Bots with a horse mount for long journeys to merchants, the Blacksmith, the Biologist and world portals, then dismount near the destination and before ordinary combat. Combat-horse fighting remains a later milestone.
- **M3 equipment progression.** Infected animals can drop the class-specific level-30 weapon families and the level-21 Pentagon Shield through an additive serverfiles overlay. Bots value positive average-damage weapons especially highly.
- **Operational safety tools.** Added a verified compressed MariaDB backup helper and a read-only horse-journey diagnostic report.
- **A bilingual live world panel.** `/map` now supports Polish and English throughout, filters M1/M2/M3/Monkey Dungeon positions, and localises classes, professions, skills, hunting missions, Biologist stages and item names from the stock Polish locale table.

### Changed

- Loot remains visible for 1.0–1.8 seconds and is picked up one stack at a time instead of disappearing in the kill tick. Bots finish an active pull before starting the loot sweep.
- Combat target selection now prioritises the remaining monsters already attacking the bot or its party, so a character does not abandon a half-finished group for a fresh target.
- Playerbot combat ignores both attackers and targets inside `ATTR_BANPK` safe zones, preventing endless attacks against invulnerable monsters near teleporters.
- Shields are now treated as core progression gear: bots buy a Battle Shield when missing one, equip better shields and include them in Blacksmith refinement decisions.
- Skill development is no longer identical within a class. Mental Warriors rotate between Strong Body, Bash, Spirit Strike and Stump priorities; Dragon Shamans alternate Dragon's Aid and Dragon Roar openings. Dagger Ninjas learn Stealth but do not waste PvE actions casting it.
- Long-distance navigation can retain its mounted state across incremental route updates. Monkey Dungeon routing blocks immediate reverse-portal loops.
- The Playerbot autospawn safety ceiling was raised from 350 to 1000 while the reproducible bundled seed remains 350 bots.
- Docker-published auth, game and panel ports accept the explicit `M2_HOST_BIND_ADDRESS` setting.

### Fixed

- Corrected the Waryong arrival point to the walkable `Town.txt` location. The previous generic teleporter coordinates landed at the unwalkable north-west border without a sectree.
- Bots carrying a Horse Medal in M2 no longer return to M1 before looking for a Stable Boy.
- Bots no longer instantly clear freshly spawned Metin loot or leave it behind because town-service logic ran first.
- Horse travel no longer repeatedly dismounts and remounts when a lightweight AI update continues an existing route.

### Verification

- Rebuilt the full r40250 game image and the panel image successfully.
- Verified 51 live bots moving on valid Waryong coordinates after deployment, with no recurrence of the old arrival coordinate or missing-sectree error.
- Verified both Polish and English panel views, map filters and localised equipment/skill details against a live 668-bot development world.

## 1.16.0 — 2026-08-24

### Changed

- **The project is now installable independently of the retired upstream repository.** Installer, updater, panel metadata, and image labels point at `TieruYT/metin2-playerbots`.
- **Native-client-only installation.** The withdrawn upstream WebClient is not fetched, published, or started. Legacy WebClient flags remain accepted only so old saved commands do not fail.
- **Bring your own files (BYOF).** No third-party r40250 server/client mirror is built in. Supply a local server archive/reference directory and, optionally, a native client archive you are authorised to use. Windows adds `-ClientArchive` and `-NoClient`.
- Added an explicit provenance and attribution document, retained upstream Git history, and clarified the licensing boundary for all game files.

### Fixed

- Corrected Docker Compose host/container port interpolation so a fresh local install can bind the panel and game ports without producing an invalid four-part port mapping.
- Verified the complete local archive path against `Reference_Server.zip`: checksum, r40250 baseline, extraction, 30 patched files, and staging all pass without fuzz or rejects.

## 1.15.6 — 2026-08-14

### Fixed

- **Fixed Issue with Admin Panel**

---

---

## 1.15.5 — 2026-08-14

### Added

- **The panel points at the community's Discord.** A quiet line in the footer of every page, and a proper card for anyone signed in to their game account, saying what is actually there: what changed in the last update, when the server is down for maintenance, and people who answer a question faster than you can search for it — and that a bug reported there is the quickest way to get it fixed. In all three languages the panel speaks.

- The address is **part of the software, not a setting.** It is written into the code rather than read from a config file, deliberately: it is where this project posts its news, so an install cannot quietly drift to a different address and leave its players pointed at nothing. An operator running their own community changes that one line, which is a change to the software and looks like one.

---

## 1.15.4 — 2026-08-14

### Fixed

- **Updating a server could leave it unable to start.** The scripts that start and supervise the game cores are installed into the images with `chmod +x`, and that cannot repair the one thing that was wrong with them. A file staged as "executable by everyone but readable only by its owner" already has the execute bit for everybody, so `+x` changes nothing — and the server does not run as the owner. A compiled program would still have run; a shell script cannot, because the shell has to *read* it. The result was a game container restarting in a loop, once a minute, on `Permission denied`, with every other container healthy and the cause nowhere near the message. The four images that install scripts now set an absolute mode instead, the way the bridge image always did — which is exactly why the bridge was the one part that never broke.

- **The updater could not apply any change to the game's own code.** Every customisation this project makes to the server — the Custom Experience, High Risk mode, the storeroom pages — is a Python script, and the updater image did not contain Python. So an update that carried one of them stopped with `FATAL: python3 is needed`, refused to go further, and left the server on its old version. It never showed up during a first install, because that runs on the host, where Python is present. The updater image now carries it.

### Note for anyone running a server

Both of these are in the images, so they take effect the next time the images are rebuilt — which is what an update does anyway. If your server is currently in the restart loop described above, the update that fixes it is the same update that was failing; rebuild the images once and it clears.

---

## 1.15.3 — 2026-08-14

### Added

- **The storeroom at the Storekeeper has three pages.** It opened with one page — 45 slots — and the only way the game ever gave you more was a premium account or an item-mall chest expander, neither of which exists on a server that sells nothing, so the second and third pages were unreachable by design. Every account now gets all three, 135 slots, the moment the cores are rebuilt. Nothing is stored per account and nothing has to be bought, claimed or unlocked. Three is also the most this game can hold: the chest is exactly 135 slots wide internally, and the build refuses to go past it rather than quietly corrupting itself. Nothing you have stored moves and nothing is lost — the extra pages are added after the slots you already have, and every client already draws as many page tabs as the server tells it to, so there is no client update to install.

- **The bonus drops off metins and bosses can be dropped, handed to another player and put in a private shop.** Every item in that drop group — Blessing Scroll, Bravery Cape, Exorcism Scroll, Concentrated Reading, the two bonus scrolls, the Experience Ring and the Thief's Gloves — shipped locked to the character who found it: no dropping it, no handing it over, no shop. All three locks are now off. Selling them to an NPC is still refused, deliberately: it is the one mistake you cannot undo.

- **Exorcism Scrolls and Concentrated Reading stack.** Both rows already claimed to be stackable and were vetoed by a second flag on the same row, so a handful of them took a handful of inventory slots. Using one out of a stack spends one — the branch that consumes them already counted down instead of deleting the item.

- **Experience Rings and Thief's Gloves stack, and only while they are unused.** A ring you have worn never merges back into the fresh pile, so you can never lose the time left on one by stacking it: a unique item keeps its remaining time in a socket, the countdown only runs while it is on, and all three places the server merges items already compare every socket before combining anything. Putting one on takes **one** out of the pile — the server moved the whole stacked item into the slot, which was harmless while these could not stack and would have destroyed the entire pile when the hour ran out, so the two changes are made together and neither is applied without the other. If your bags are completely full the ring is not put on at all, rather than the rest of the pile being thrown away to make room. Quivers are untouched.

### Fixed

- **The bonus items dropped by metin stones were the wrong ones.** They were the pair that re-rolls the two *rare* bonus slots — the fifth and sixth, which almost nothing in this game ever fills and no ordinary item shows. Players were being handed items that appeared to do nothing on everything they owned. They are now the pair that works on bonuses one to four, which is what a player actually reads off a weapon or a piece of armour.

- **Ordinary monsters dropped boss loot.** The drop table was attached to 130 monsters it was never meant to include — everything at the rank just below a boss, the stone apes among them. That rank is a common monster in this distribution, not a boss, so the metin and boss reward was falling off things that die by the dozen. The table now covers exactly what it says: 68 metin stones and 108 bosses.

### Note for anyone running a server

Two of these changes are in the game's C++ and not in a data file — the three storeroom pages and the split that takes a single ring out of a stack. **The cores have to be rebuilt** for this release to do anything; re-running the installer is enough. Your database is not touched, and characters, accounts and stored items all survive.

---

## 1.15.2 — 2026-08-13

### Fixed

- **Killing another High Risk player never costs reputation.** It was already meant to be free, and mostly was — but only as a side effect of the killer mark the mode keeps lit, and that mark blinks: it is cleared the moment its wearer dies and only comes back a few seconds later, and there is a gap right after someone opts in before it is lit at all. A kill landing in either gap quietly took 20,000 reputation off the killer for something the mode promises is free. The rule now asks whether the victim is in High Risk instead of watching for the mark.

- **Updating with `--domain` forgot the e-mail address your certificate is registered with.** It was only ever read back from your server's settings inside the branch that runs when you *don't* name a domain — and naming it is exactly what the panel's own update command does. Passing `--domain` therefore skipped it and handed the certificate tool an empty address. It is now read back first, whichever way you run it.

## 1.15.0 — 2026-08-13

### Fixed

- **High Risk did nothing at all, on every server built from this repository.** The mode was offered at level 15, the player chose it, the choice was saved — and then nothing happened: they were not attackable, not marked, dropped nothing extra on death and got none of the bonuses. Only the *quest* half was ever staged into a build. The half that gives the choice meaning is a change to the game core, and that change existed only on the machine where it had been applied by hand; the server tree is re-staged from the pristine archive on every build, so it was never in anyone else's server. It is now applied during the build, every time, and the build refuses to start if it is missing rather than quietly producing a server where the mode is decorative.
- If you have High Risk switched on, this is the update that makes it real. Nobody has to re-choose anything: the choice was being recorded correctly the whole time and takes effect the moment the cores are rebuilt.

### Changed

- **High Risk sets your combat mode for you.** Choosing the mode put you in reach of everyone else in it without letting you fight back: whether *you* may hit someone is decided by your own combat mode, and that is Peace until you change it by hand. It is now set to Free for as long as High Risk is on, and kept there — the game quietly resets it in a few places, such as when a duel ends, and it comes straight back. Game masters and characters below the protection level are left alone, exactly as the rest of the game leaves them alone.
- **High Risk is now a pool, not a licence.** It only ever pairs you with other players who also chose it. Someone in No Risk can no longer kill a High Risk player and take what they drop, and a High Risk player can no longer hunt someone who never opted in — neither direction works, inside an empire or across empires. Both of you chose, or there is no fight. Guild wars, castle sieges, duels and the arena are settled before this rule and keep working between the two modes, because those are consensual on their own terms.
- **A High Risk death costs more.** Dying with the mode on now drops something from your bags **one time in two** (was one in ten) and something you are wearing **one time in ten** (was one in five). Quantities are unchanged — eight items from the bags, one worn item — and so is everything about which items can be lost at all. Characters who are simply Cruel are not affected: they still drop on exactly the odds the game shipped with, which is what the mode borrowed before and no longer does.

### Added

- **Skill books stack, and only with books of the same skill.** Part of the Custom Experience. Books for one skill now merge into a single slot instead of taking a fresh one each, whether you pick them up, drag them together or store them in the chest. Books for *different* skills never merge, and this is not a promise the change had to make good on itself: the generic Skill Book is one and the same item number for every skill it can teach — it carries the skill in a socket rather than in its number — and all three places the server merges items already compare every socket before they combine anything. Two books that teach different things differ there and are refused.
- Reading one book out of a stack now spends one book. The core deleted the *item* when a book was read, which was the same thing while books could not stack and would have thrown away the whole pile once they could, so the two changes are made together and neither is applied without the other.
- Off unless the Custom Experience is on. Unlike the Blessing Scroll, there is nothing in the shipped files that contradicts itself here — all 45 skill books agree that they do not stack — so this is a deliberate change rather than a fix, and it sits with the other deliberate ones.

## 1.13.1 — 2026-08-13

### Fixed

- **Nothing could be picked up.** Neither items nor Yang, by key or by clicking — the character walked to the drop and left it lying there. Removing a diagnostic line before the release took the body of an `if` with it, so the branch adopted the next statement and the pick-up was nested inside a condition that could never be true at the same time. It compiled without a warning. Browser client 1.11.6; the game data is unchanged, so this is a 17 MB update rather than 1.7 GB.

## 1.13.0 — 2026-08-13

### Added

- **Enable Custom Experience? — one question, and everything behind it.** The installer now asks once, before it downloads anything, whether your server should play the way the original files do or the friendlier way this project has been using. It is **off** by default and nothing changes for anyone who says no. Say yes and you get: items and Yang picked up from twice as far away, a horse that always comes when you call it, no waiting until tomorrow between the Horse Medal steps, bonus drops on 283 metin stones and bosses, Musk Oil stocked in the General Store, High Risk offered to your players, and everyone 20% faster on foot. Rates are untouched and so are your existing characters.
- **It is written down, and it is replayable.** The answer is kept as `M2_CUSTOM_EXPERIENCE` in your server's `.env`, so every later update rebuilds the server you have instead of the one the defaults would produce, and the update command the panel shows you names it. For an unattended install, `--custom-experience` / `--no-custom-experience` on Linux, `-CustomExperience` / `-NoCustomExperience` on Windows, or `M2_CUSTOM_EXPERIENCE=1` in the environment. `--yes` takes the default and leaves it off. Everything behind the switch now lives in `files/custom/` and is applied to the server tree at every build, so it survives updates instead of being quietly reverted by the next one — which is exactly what used to happen to changes made by hand.
- Turning it on also turns High Risk on and sets the movement-speed bonus to 20%, as starting points rather than as locks: `M2_HIGH_RISK=0` and a movement-speed bonus you have chosen yourself both still win, and both are carried forward untouched by later updates.
- **High Risk — a mode your players choose, at level 15.** They are asked once, shortly after they reach it: live dangerously, or carry on as before. High Risk means anyone may attack and kill them, anywhere, their own empire included, and nobody is punished for doing it. In exchange they earn 50% more experience and find 50% more drops — and when they die they drop items the way the cruellest characters do, out of their bags and off their bodies, using the game's own Cruel rules rather than a new one. No Risk changes nothing at all.
- **It is never a trap.** A character in High Risk is drawn the way a player-killer is drawn, to themselves and to everyone around them, so nobody is in it without knowing and nobody attacks one by accident. There is a line in the chat window at every login while it is on, and the choice can be reversed as often as they like at any Guardian or City Guard.
- Town safe zones still protect everyone, High Risk included — killing inside one would break every shop standing in it. Characters below level 15 and game masters are outside the mode entirely.
- To run a server without it, delete `files/high_risk.quest` before assembling, or set `M2_HIGH_RISK=0`. The rest of the change does nothing on its own: without that file no character can enter the mode and every check falls back to the ordinary rules.
- **The browser client keeps what it downloads.** It used to fetch half a gigabyte of game data in the background and lose it again by the next visit — not because the server said so, but because a browser's ordinary cache is one shared pool that the game's own reading pushes things out of. It now keeps that data in storage of its own. Measured: 144 downloads on a first visit, **one** on the second.
- **If it crashes, it offers to say so.** A dialog appears with what went wrong, a box to describe what you were doing, and a button to send it. Nothing leaves the browser unless that button is pressed, and the complete report can be read first. Account name and password are not in it — they are not reachable from the page at all.
- **Playing in the browser fills the window.** The game followed a fixed 1024×768 and let the browser stretch it. It now follows the window, including full screen, and remembers if you pin a resolution instead.

### Fixed

- **The Drachenhort quest paid out its own fee.** Handing in the items credited 150,000 Yang instead of charging it, and it could be repeated. Anyone who found it had unlimited money. This one is not behind the Custom Experience switch and never will be: it is a hole in the shipped files, it is open on every server running them untouched, and every server gets it closed.
- **A character with a friend, or in a guild of more than one, could not play in the browser.** The screen stayed grey at login and never finished loading. One line of the interface used a variable name that Python 3 no longer allows there, and it ran on every friend and every guild member.
- **A script error no longer takes the whole browser client down with it.** It is written to the console and the game carries on — which is how the bug above was found in seconds after days of guessing.
- Skills and emoticons can be dragged onto the quick slots again, and from one slot to another.
- Selling something no longer quotes a price with decimals in it. The price charged was always correct; only the confirmation was wrong.
- A weapon no longer stays in your hands after you take it off, and a metin's aura stays on the metin instead of occasionally landing on the player.
- Items and Yang are picked up from 600 units away on foot and 800 on a mount, instead of 300. With the Custom Experience on.
- Blessing Scrolls and Bravery Capes stack, along with eight more items that claimed to and never did — including Blessing Marbles and Scrolls of Correction. Every server gets this: the rows say they stack and then do not, which is a mistake in the table rather than a decision.
- The Horse Medal quests no longer make you wait between steps, and characters already waiting are released instead of serving out the rest. With the Custom Experience on.
- The Musk Oil quest points at the General Store, where the oil is actually sold, instead of an Item Shop this server does not have. With the Custom Experience on, which is also what puts the oil on the counter — the two go together, or the quest would send players to an empty shelf.
- Seven quests handed out rewards that did not match what they promised — among them one that skipped its Yang, experience and level-up entirely. Every server gets these: in each case the quest contradicts its own text, and the pack itself says which side was meant.

## 1.12.2 — 2026-08-12

### Fixed

- **The installer survives being run from a directory that was deleted.** Uninstall, then reinstall from the same terminal, and the installer used to stop three minutes in with `fatal: Unable to read current working directory` — which reads like a network problem and is not one. It now says what actually happened and carries on. The same protection covers the installer's own doing: it refreshes its checkout by deleting it, which pulled the rug out from under anyone who happened to be standing in it.
- [UNINSTALL.md](UNINSTALL.md) now says to leave the directory before deleting it, and shows that error so it can be recognised.

## 1.12.1 — 2026-08-12

- **[UNINSTALL.md](UNINSTALL.md)** — how to remove an installation completely and put a fresh one in its place. It says which of the five places an installation lives in can be thrown away freely, which one holds every character on your server, and how to save that one first. It also lists the three cheaper things to try before wiping anything.

## 1.12.0 — 2026-08-12

### Added

- **A second place to download from.** When MEGA answers `509 over quota` — the share's daily allowance, spent by other people, nothing to do with your machine — the installer now moves straight on to another copy of the same archive instead of stopping. It is the identical file and it is checked against the same checksum, so an install that used to mean coming back in a few hours carries on within seconds. This covers the three big downloads: the browser client's data, the desktop client, and the server files.
- Nothing to set up. The links travel in `artifacts.json` and an update picks them up. A link you supplied yourself is still tried first, and a fallback is only ever reached after the one before it has already failed.

## 1.11.13 — 2026-08-12

### Fixed

- The installer no longer tells you to copy the browser client onto the panel's volume by hand. It printed `docker compose cp ./browser panel:…` whenever playing in the browser was switched on — a leftover from before 1.11.0, when that really was the only way. Since then the installer fetches and installs the client itself, and the command it printed can only fail: there is no `./browser` directory in an install, so it answers `lstat …/browser: no such file or directory`. Reported by an operator who did exactly what the installer told him to.
- The same instruction is corrected in the Docker README, where it also pointed one directory too high — a client copied there is invisible to both the panel and nginx, which serve `browser/current`.

## 1.11.12 — 2026-08-12

### Added

- **A server-wide movement-speed bonus.** Set `M2_MOVE_SPEED_BONUS` in `.env` to a percentage and every character gets it at login — no item, no button, nothing for players to know about. `0` is off, which is what a server that says nothing gets. Changing the number takes effect at each character's next login; nothing has to be cleaned up.

## 1.11.11 — 2026-08-12

- The "What is this?" box on the front page says you can play in the browser — on servers that offer it — and no longer explains the panel to people who are looking for the game.

## 1.11.10 — 2026-08-12

- The front page puts the game account first, then the ways to play in one frame: **JETZT IM BROWSER SPIELEN**, a line saying **ODER**, and the download with its steps.
- The account card says what an account is for and that the same one works in the browser and in the download.

## 1.11.9 — 2026-08-12

- After registering, a player is shown the ways into the game this server really offers — the browser, the download, or both side by side with **ODER** between them.
- The browser card stands out and its button opens the game in a **new tab**, so the panel stays open behind it.

## 1.11.8 — 2026-08-12

- You are asked which clients you want **before** anything large is downloaded, instead of after.
- The Windows installer downloads only the server too, about 220 MB instead of 1.6 GB.
- The release notes below are written in plain language.

## 1.11.7 — 2026-08-12

- The Windows installer no longer stops at the question about which clients to install.
- A new install downloads only the server, about 220 MB instead of 1.6 GB.
- The desktop client is fetched from its own download.

## 1.11.6 — 2026-08-12

- The admin panel starts again on servers that use a domain name.

## 1.11.5 — 2026-08-12

- **Play in Browser** hands out a link that works on servers with HTTPS.
- The client download is fast again and no longer blocks the panel while it runs.

## 1.11.4 — 2026-08-12

- Updating now really does update the browser client.
- The installer writes its web-server settings again.

## 1.11.3 — 2026-08-12

- The browser client starts instead of stopping at "starting…".
- The browser client reaches servers that use a domain name.
- **Play in Browser** works on servers with HTTPS.
- The game stutters far less in the browser.
- A file that was briefly missing is no longer remembered as missing for a year.

## 1.11.2 — 2026-08-12

- The **Play in Browser** card appears in the panel again.

## 1.11.1 — 2026-08-12

- A server that chose the browser client now actually gets one.

## 1.11.0 — 2026-08-11

# 🌍 Play in the browser — no download

## Your players click a link and they are in the game. No client to download, no installation, nothing to set up on their side.

The installer asks which clients you want to offer — browser, desktop, or both
— and fetches only what you chose. Servers installed before this keep working
exactly as they are; the browser client is simply offered on your next update.

### Added

- Play in the browser: a link is all a player needs.
- The installer asks which clients you want and downloads only those.
- The browser client is installed for you, checked, and kept up to date.
- An update to the browser client is a small download, not the whole game again.
- Updating it cannot leave a player with half a client, and it can be undone.
- **Play in Browser** appears on the panel's front page once everything is ready.

## 1.10.0 — 2026-08-11

- The item search works on a local install and in older browsers, and says so when it cannot reach the server.
- Setting a level above what your server allows now tells you, instead of quietly doing nothing.
- The highest character level is 120 by default. Change `M2_MAX_LEVEL` in `.env` to raise it.
- **Game language** and **Admin passphrase** moved to the bottom of the admin page, under their own heading.

---

## 1.9.0 — 2026-08-11

### Added

- **Game language** on the admin page. The server files carry fifteen
  languages; pick one and the game speaks it — quest text, system messages,
  item and monster names. The game restarts for well under a minute.
- The download page says which language the game is in.
- After a switch, the panel shows players who already downloaded the game how
  to change their copy: one file to rename, nothing to download again.
- The client the panel hands out is built in the server's language.

### Fixed

- The patch log button had two translations, of which only the second was ever
  used.

---

## 1.8.0 — 2026-08-10

### Added

- **Admin passphrase** on the admin page, just under the introduction. Pick
  your own instead of the generated one; it takes effect straight away and you
  stay logged in.

### Changed

- The installer shows the admin passphrase every time it runs, including one
  you chose yourself in the panel, and never changes it behind your back.
- The introduction no longer says teleport and running speed are missing from
  a normal install. They are there; they need the player to be logged in.

---

## 1.7.0 — 2026-08-10

### Fixed

- The item search shows the names your game actually uses. The index had been
  built from the German name file while the server and the client use the
  English one, so nothing you saw in game matched what the panel offered.
- Searching for several words now needs all of them. "Full Moon Sword" no
  longer offers Half Moon Sword as well.
- Item numbers work in the search box, with or without the `#`. Typing `299`
  or `#299` finds that item, and `29` offers everything starting with it.

### Added

- **Show more** at the bottom of the item list, which used to stop at forty
  without saying so.
- German and Turkish item names are search keywords, so an item can be found
  by whichever of the three names you know.

---

## 1.6.0 — 2026-08-10

### Added

- Game master ranks on the player page. Pick a rank to give somebody the
  in-game admin commands, or set them back to a normal player. Granting takes
  effect immediately, even mid-game; taking a rank away applies at the player's
  next login.

### Fixed

- The game cores' admin interface had no password, which made an empty one
  correct. It now gets a generated password, like the others.
- The tutorial no longer claims that teleport and running speed do not work.

---

## 1.5.0 — 2026-08-10

### Changed

- Updating no longer asks for the address players connect to, or for your
  domain name. Both are kept from your settings. The address is only asked
  about when this machine has moved to a different one.

### Added

- `--no-domain`, to drop the domain a server was set up with and go back to
  plain HTTP on its address.

---

## 1.4.1 — 2026-08-10

### Fixed

- Running speed can be changed back. "Normal (reset)" resets it, a slower
  setting is slower than a faster one, and characters that were sped up before
  this version are put right the next time you set their speed.

---

## 1.4.0 — 2026-08-10

### Added

- The panel's in-game actions work. Items, yang and levels reach a character
  who is logged in straight away instead of at their next login, and teleport
  and running speed work at all.

Set `M2_INGAME_HELPER=0` in `.env` to leave the helper out.

---

## 1.3.4 — 2026-08-10

### Fixed

- The in-game helper no longer crashes the channel it runs on. It is still not
  installed by default — nobody has played on the fix yet.

---

## 1.3.3 — 2026-08-10

### Fixed

- The item search works in English and Turkish. It matched the whole box
  against German names, so "Full Moon Sword" found nothing while
  "Vollmondschwert" worked. It now matches word by word, translates the common
  ones, and ranks by how many words fit.

---

## 1.3.2 — 2026-08-10

### Fixed

- The in-game helper introduced in 1.3.0 disconnects the character it acts on.
  It is no longer installed. Items, yang and levels work as they did before
  1.3.0 — written to the account, visible at the next login — and teleport and
  running speed refuse instead of dropping the player.

**If you are on 1.3.0 or 1.3.1, update.** Until you do, avoid the buttons on a
character's page while somebody is playing on them.

---

## 1.3.1 — 2026-08-10

### Fixed

- Updating a server never picked up changes to the game itself. The source was
  staged once and reused, so the rebuild produced the same binaries and every
  C++ change since the install was dropped. If you updated to 1.3.0 and teleport
  still does not work, update again.

---

## 1.3.0 — 2026-08-10

### Added

- Teleport and running speed work. The helper that carries them out is now
  built and installed with the server.
- Items, yang and levels reach a character who is logged in straight away,
  instead of at their next login.

### Fixed

- On a Linux host the game could start with no quests loaded at all, and still
  report itself healthy. Staged quest files could carry permissions the server
  account could not read.

### Security

- The database function the helper uses accepts only statements against the
  panel's own queue table.

---

## 1.2.3 — 2026-08-10

### Fixed

- The update command shown in the panel now includes the options the server was
  installed with, such as `--domain` and `--email`. It previously showed the
  bare one-liner, which on the next update would have dropped the certificate.

---

## 1.2.2 — 2026-08-10

### Fixed

- Giving an item, yang or a level to a character who is logged in no longer
  claims they were not in game. It says the change was written to the account
  and appears at their next login.
- Teleport and running speed now say that nothing in the game answered and
  that nothing was changed, instead of suggesting the game server might be
  down.

---

## 1.2.1 — 2026-08-10

### Changed

- Removed the paragraph about the deleted `admin` and `test` accounts from the
  panel's introduction.

---

## 1.2.0 — 2026-08-10

### Changed

- The patch log splits the changelog at the version you are running: "What an
  update would bring" lists only the releases you do not have yet, and "What
  you are running" the rest. No release appears in both.

---

## 1.1.9 — 2026-08-10

### Changed

- The patch log shows the changelog once. When an update was available it was
  printed twice, under two headings, with the same releases in both.

---

## 1.1.8 — 2026-08-10

### Changed

- The update page now says to re-run the command that installed the server,
  and what an update leaves alone, instead of explaining a setting that is off.

---

## 1.1.7 — 2026-08-10

### Changed

- Removed the heading above the changelog on the patch log page. The file
  brings its own, so there were two.

---

## 1.1.6 — 2026-08-10

### Added

- A "Check for the latest version" button on the patch log page. It asks
  straight away instead of waiting for the daily check.

---

## 1.1.5 — 2026-08-10

### Changed

- The installer now ends with the panel address and the game, instead of
  opening with them and scrolling them off the screen.
- A local Windows install no longer prints an admin passphrase. The panel does
  not ask for one there.
- Removed the note about the shipped `admin` and `test` accounts. They are
  deleted during setup.

---

## 1.1.4 — 2026-08-10

### Fixed

- The Windows installer now updates an existing server as well, and shows the
  installed and published versions before asking. Re-running it previously
  re-applied the settings and restarted without fetching anything.

---

## 1.1.3 — 2026-08-10

### Changed

- When a server is already installed, the installer shows which version it is
  on and which one is published, then asks whether to update or to only
  re-apply the settings and restart.
- A server installed before versions existed is recognised as such and offered
  the update.

---

## 1.1.2 — 2026-08-10

### Fixed

- Re-running the installer on a server that was already installed now updates
  it. It used to rewrite the settings and restart the containers without
  fetching anything, so the server stayed on the version it was installed with.

---

## 1.1.1 — 2026-08-10

### Changed

- The patch log has its own card in the admin area, with a button. It used to
  be a grey line at the bottom of the page.
- The card highlights itself when a newer version is available.
- The front page shows the version number only. The patch log and the update
  notice are in the admin area.
- Shorter wording when the update check cannot reach the server.

---

## 1.1.0 — 2026-08-09

### Added

- A `VERSION` file and this changelog.
- An update check in the admin panel. It compares your version against the
  published one roughly once a day and tells you when a newer one exists, with
  the release notes for it. Can be switched off with `M2_UPDATE_CHECK=0`.
- A patch-log page in the panel, showing this file.
- The command that updates your server, shown on that page. The installer
  records it, so the panel shows the exact line for your install. Re-running
  the installer pulls the published version, rebuilds and restarts, and keeps
  your database, passwords and settings.
- A one-click update button on Linux. Off by default; see
  [UPDATING.md](UPDATING.md) to turn it on. On Windows the panel shows the
  command to paste instead.

---

## 1.0.0 — 2026-08-09

First public release. A Metin2 r40250 server that runs on ordinary Linux — or
on a Windows PC, for one person — installed with a single command.

### Added

- The Linux port, as a 109 KB patch over 28 files. A fresh copy of the upstream
  package plus this patch reproduces the running server byte for byte.
- Docker packaging: game cores, MariaDB, the admin panel and a client builder,
  in one compose stack.
- One-command installers for Linux and Windows. The Linux one publishes the
  game ports and opens the firewall; the Windows one binds everything to
  `127.0.0.1` and creates no firewall rule.
- The admin panel — English, German and Turkish. Server rates, giving items and
  yang, levels, password-reset links, registration and a client download.
- A client builder that patches the game to point at your server and offers it
  for download. On a Windows install it unpacks the game and puts a
  `Metin2 Singleplayer` shortcut on the Desktop.

### Fixed

- The client download returned 500 on every request. The panel could not create
  the file it counts downloads in.
- The panel showed a running server as offline, and the player count stayed at
  zero.
- "Give 1000 potions" silently gave 255.
- Items were refused to characters that had room for them: the panel searched
  one inventory page of 45 where r40250 gives four.
- The dashboard reported "the database cannot be reached" for a character who
  had never played.
- The game archive was downloaded twice, once for the server and once for the
  client.
- A path containing a space broke the client build.

### Security

- The shipped `admin` and `test` accounts are deleted during setup, together
  with their game-master entry.
- Download limits: three per address per day, plus a server-wide daily ceiling.
- Rate limits on registration, account login and the admin passphrase.
- Passwords are generated on the machine at install time.
