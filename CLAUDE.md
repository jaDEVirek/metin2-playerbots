# metin2-suite

Single-player Metin2 server suite: a Linux port of the r40250 server, a launcher,
a Flask admin panel, and the playerbot AI that populates the world.

## Layout

The engine source is **not in this repository** and never will be — see
`linux-port/fetch-sources.sh`. Our side of the server is one overlay:

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `linux-port/overlays/playerbot/src/game/src/` | The playerbot AI, split into implementation fragments (see below). `playerbot_manager.cpp` is the tick and whatever has not been lifted out yet. |
| `linux-port/overlays/playerbot/src/game/src/playerbot_world_rules.h` | Pure travel policy, no engine types. Unit-tested. The model for extracting logic. |
| `linux-port/patches/` | Patches applied to the pristine engine source. |
| `files/admin_panel.py` | Flask admin panel. The copy under
`linux-port/docker/panel/app/` is staged there by `prepare-context.sh` and is
gitignored -- editing that one changes the running panel and commits nothing. |
| `tests/playerbot_world_rules_test.cpp` | The only C++ unit test. |

Reference copies of the engine, needed to check any API before using it:

- `../m2src-cache/tree/port40250/server/` — staged, patched build tree (`game/src`, `common/`, `extern/include`)
- `../../backups/m1-best-*/game-server/game/src/` — engine sources incl. `fishing.cpp`, `char.cpp`
- `../m2src-cache/tree/server40250/share/` — runtime data: `conf/item_proto.txt`, `conf/item_names_pl.txt`, `conf/mob_names_pl.txt`, `locale/english/map/*/`

## Verifying a change

There is no local compiler; the build is 32-bit C++23 in Docker. Syntax-check the
overlay against the real headers — this catches almost everything and takes about
a minute:

```bash
cd ../m2src-cache/tree/port40250
cp <repo>/linux-port/overlays/playerbot/src/game/src/playerbot_manager.cpp server/game/src/
cp <repo>/linux-port/overlays/playerbot/src/game/src/playerbot_world_rules.h server/game/src/
MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1 docker run --rm -v "$(pwd -W)":/src -w /src/server/game/src gcc:13 bash -c \
  "apt-get update -qq >/dev/null 2>&1 && apt-get install -y -qq g++-multilib >/dev/null 2>&1; \
   g++ -fsyntax-only -m32 -std=c++23 -Wall -Wextra -Wno-unused-parameter -fexceptions \
   -D_THREAD_SAFE -DNDEBUG -DBOOST_BIND_GLOBAL_PLACEHOLDERS \
   -I../../../extern/include -I../../liblua/include -I../../libserverkey playerbot_manager.cpp; \
   echo EXIT=\$?"
```

`-m32` is mandatory: `packet.h` static-asserts a 32-bit `time_t` and the wire/DB
layouts depend on it. Restore the staged copies afterwards — they belong to the
build cache, not to us.

Unit test:

```bash
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd -W)":/w -w /w gcc:13 \
  bash -c "g++ -Wall -Wextra -o /tmp/t tests/playerbot_world_rules_test.cpp && /tmp/t"
```

Nothing here can be runtime-tested locally; the live signal comes from operators
running ~350 bots. Say plainly what was compiled versus what was observed.

### Adding a source file

Nothing to do. Drop a `playerbot_*.h` or `playerbot_*.cpp` into
`overlays/playerbot/src/game/src/` and every step finds it: `prepare-context.sh`
discovers the directory, the engine `Makefile` takes `$(wildcard
playerbot_*.cpp)`, the update packager expands `playerbot_*` in
`server-update-files.txt`, and the launcher copies the whole directory into the
build context before each build.

This used to cost five edits in `prepare-context.sh` alone plus a patch edit,
which is exactly why the manager grew to twelve thousand lines instead of being
split up -- and why 1.22.4 and 1.23.2 both shipped a manager without its own
headers and would not compile on any player's machine. If you add a step that
handles these files, make it discover them too. Never write another list.

## The playerbot sources

Everything shares **one translation unit and one anonymous namespace**, so
definition order *is* dependency order: a helper must appear above its callers.
The split is therefore a sequence of implementation fragments, included in
dependency order at the top of `playerbot_manager.cpp`:

| File | What |
|---|---|
| `playerbot_types.h` | Tuning constants, enums, `TPlayerBotAIState`, the state map, and the two goal/action transitions every subsystem makes. |
| `playerbot_log.h` | Saying something once for three hundred bots: a tag, a minute, and a count of what was swallowed. |
| `playerbot_battle_horse.h` | Earning the horse that can fight: the desert trial, and what the stable keeper does at the end of it. |
| `playerbot_config.h` | The weights an operator moves in the panel while the world runs. Re-read from a file every five seconds; neutral when it is missing. |
| `playerbot_world_rules.h` | Pure travel policy. No engine types, unit-tested. |
| `playerbot_navigation.h` | Where a bot may stand and whether two points connect. Calls nothing above it. |
| `playerbot_world_memory.h` | What the population has learned about the world, as opposed to about itself. |
| `playerbot_movement.h` | Following a route: mounts, waypoints, portals, and the known-metin registry. |
| `playerbot_gear.h` | What a bot wears and carries: equipment scoring, the progression ladder, arrows, potions. |
| `playerbot_activities.h` | The horse, and fishing. Each owns the whole tick while it runs. |
| `playerbot_missions.h` | The Biologist's collections and the level-up hunt, driven without a quest dialog. |
| `playerbot_skills.h` | The character sheet: stat points, the job's skill order, keeping buffs up. |
| `playerbot_combat.h` | How a swing or a cast is sent: the packets a bot has no client to generate. |
| `playerbot_economy.h` | Money and bag: junk, merchants, the blacksmith, market stalls. |
| `playerbot_bonus.h` | The bonus lines on worn gear: what a line is worth, what finishes an item, and what a bot will pay to change it. |
| `playerbot_travel.h` | Where a bot ought to be, and crossing between maps. |
| `playerbot_planner.h` | Which long-term goal wins: the candidates, their base priorities, and the three gates no weight can touch. |
| `playerbot_guild.h` | Founding and recruiting a guild, and who a bot has got on with. |
| `playerbot_town.h` | A town visit end to end, as a state machine that survives being interrupted. |
| `playerbot_market.h` | Buying from another bot's counter: what is worth having, the walk to the stall, and the purchase. |
| `playerbot_chat_trade.h` | Trading over the chat: what a bot shouts about its counter and its wants, and the whisper it answers a player's "Kupie"/"Sprzedam" with. Fed by patch 0007. |
| `playerbot_loot.h` | Picking things up, in and out of a fight, without sweeping the floor. |
| `playerbot_survival.h` | Saving progress, breaking off a losing fight, and the walk back after dying. |
| `playerbot_wandering.h` | What a bot does on a hunting map when nothing is asking for its attention. |
| `playerbot_status.h` | What a bot shows above its head, and the words for it. |
| `playerbot_targeting.h` | Choosing what to hit and hitting it, including the claim that keeps hundreds of bots off the same monster. |
| `playerbot_manager.cpp` | Personality, party, upkeep, the watchdog - and `CPlayerBotManager` with the tick. |

These are fragments, not normal headers: each defines objects, relies on the
engine headers the manager includes above it, and reopens the same anonymous
namespace. Include each exactly once, from `playerbot_manager.cpp`, in an order
that respects what it calls. A fragment that needs something from a later
subsystem forward-declares it rather than pulling it in -- `playerbot_gear.h`
does this for `GetPlayerBotNpcApproach`.

`playerbot_manager.cpp` is now the manager: who a bot is, its party, the small
upkeep passes, the inactivity watchdog, and `CPlayerBotManager` itself. The tick
stays there on purpose - it is the one thing that has to see every subsystem, so
moving it would only mean declaring all of them somewhere else.

Find a subsystem by its entry point rather than by line number:

- Planning: `PlanPlayerBotLongTermGoal`, `GetPlayerBotWeight`, `RefreshPlayerBotWeights`
- Navigation/travel: `MovePlayerBot`, `TransitionPlayerBotMap` (an instant warp),
  `MovePlayerBotToWorldPortal` (walks), `ManagePlayerBotWorldTravel`
- Combat: `FindDistributedTarget`, `ExecutePlayerBotBasicAttack`,
  `ExecutePlayerBotAttackSkill`, `HandlePlayerBotMultiPull`
- Economy: `ManagePlayerBotEquipment`, `IsPlayerBotJunkItem`,
  `ManagePlayerBot*Merchant`, `ManagePlayerBotRefining`, `ManagePlayerBotPrivateShop`,
  `ManagePlayerBotBonusReroll`
- Activities: `ManagePlayerBotHorse`, `ManagePlayerBotFishing`,
  `ManagePlayerBotBiologist`, `HandlePlayerBotTownVisit`
- Planning/report: `PlanPlayerBotLongTermGoal`, `BuildPlayerBotStatusText`

`CPlayerBotManager::Update` is the tick. Order matters and is load-bearing:
releasing an open private shop runs first -- engine state must not depend on
which subsystem wins the tick -- then the goal planner, then the subsystem hooks
(each `continue`s to claim the tick), and target acquisition and attacking run
**last**. A subsystem that owns the tick therefore also suppresses combat and the
gear pass.

### The spawn ceiling is the registry, not the slider

`PLAYERBOT_AUTOSPAWN_COUNT` asks for a number; `CPlayerBotManager::LoadRegisteredBots`
decides what is available. It accepts a PID only when the ledger row says
`complete`/`adopted` **and** the account login is exactly `playerbot_NNN` for that
PID, the social id matches, and `player_index` holds that one character in empire 2.
Anything else -- a bot renamed by hand, a character from an older bootstrap that
used different account names -- stays in the database and never spawns. That guard
is deliberate: it is what stops a raw PID turning a real player's character into a
bot. Raising the ceiling on a world like that means growing the canonical cohort
(`BOT_COUNT` in `generate_seed.py`), not loosening the rule.

Read the two lines the core logs at startup before believing any count:

```
PLAYERBOT_AUTH: loaded 511 registered bot identities
PLAYERBOT: autospawn requested=750 registered_started=511 in Chunjo
```

### Traps this file has already sprung

- `TPlayerBotAIState` member init order must match declaration order, or `-Wreorder`
  fires (the build uses `-w`, so check with `-Wall` explicitly).
- `IsPlayerBotJunkItem` **defaults to `return true`**. Anything worth keeping needs
  an explicit exemption, or bots vendor it on the next town trip.
- The inactivity watchdog resets a bot that has not moved, fought or cast for
  ~90 s. Any activity that legitimately stands still must be exempted there.
- `TMonkeyVisitContext` is initialised positionally in the test. Inserting a field
  silently shifts every later value while still compiling.
- `CHARACTER::fishing()` dereferences the sectree map and tile with no null check.
- **The route planner reads its own grid, never the sectree.** `m_blocked` in
  `playerbot_navigation.h` is `ATTR_BLOCK|ATTR_OBJECT` sampled at every cell's
  centre when the grid is built, and `IsLiveBlockedCell` asks the engine for the
  same point - so inside A*, string pulling and goal snapping they are the same
  answer at a thousand times the price. A corridor search that asked live for
  every neighbour of every node cost 31 s of every 60 at 850 bots. Only the
  walk (`SegmentClearWorld`, one segment per tick) asks live, as the safety net
  for anything placed after the grid was built.
- **Hubs are placed by hand, chosen by memory.** A hunting hub is a
  `TPlayerBotHuntingHub` - a spawn-point coordinate, a level band, and whether
  it is a party's work - and `ChoosePlayerBotHuntingHub` picks among the ones a
  bot qualifies for by what `playerbot_world_memory.h` has seen there: every
  target search records the monsters within reach of the bot that ran it in a
  6400-unit cell, halved every ten minutes. The memory says how full a place
  is; the table says where a place is. Do not let it invent places - a bot
  standing where a pack respawned round it is not standing where the pack
  lives. Orc Valley's table is banded: Fanatic islands 30-39, the density hubs
  36+, the three Black Orc camps 40+ with a party, the Curse Book island 45+
  with a party. `PLAYERBOT_SPOT:` logs each choice and, every ten minutes, the
  richest cells per map; a cell that keeps coming top with no hub on it is a
  hub the table is missing. A boss hub is the exception:
  `TPlayerBotHuntingHub::wBossRace` names the boss and
  `IsPlayerBotBossAlive` asks the sector whether he stands, because one
  monster every half hour is a density of nothing and the boss hubs were
  never chosen in a day of logs. Bokjung has no hub table, so its Bestial
  Captain is a detour in the M2 wander branch instead. Parties form on
  every frontier map (`IsPlayerBotPartyEligible`) because a map change
  dissolves one - a party made in the valley never reached V1.
- **A hub is chosen by share, distance and time, in that order.** The score
  is the monsters in reach divided among the bots already there, halved at
  20 km, and a choice is kept for four minutes. The first version scored by
  share alone and re-chose on every wander decision: bots crossed the valley
  for a slightly better camp and back again - 160 to 334 far plans a minute
  against 26 to 65, and the tick at 57 s of every 60.
- **The engine patches under `overlays/playerbot/patches/` are applied with
  `patch --fuzz=0` by prepare-context.sh**, in order, on top of the staged
  port source - so a new one is diffed against the builder container's copy
  of the file (which is that state), not against `m2src-cache`. That state
  is **before** the High Risk step, which runs later in the same script and
  inserts `#include "high_risk.h"`: 0006 once carried that line as context,
  applied by luck on any machine whose cache already held a High Risk tree,
  and failed every fresh `installer/install.sh`. Dry-run a new patch against
  `m2src-cache/tree/port40250/server` with `--fuzz=0` before shipping it. 0006 adds two
  CONFIG tokens (`MOONLIGHT_CHEST_PERMILLE`, `..._STONE_PERMILLE`, rendered by
  `m2-render-config` from `M2_MOONLIGHT_CHEST_*`) and, in `CreateDropItem`,
  tops a Metin stone up to three skill books and rolls the chest. The chest's
  contents come from `serverfiles/special_item_group.moonlight.txt`; the
  engine keeps the *first* group it reads for a vnum, so the Dockerfile cuts
  the stock 50011 block out before appending ours. `playerbot_consumables.h`
  opens the chest and drinks the boosters; the bonus scrolls, speed potions
  and big potions it holds go through the code that already handled them.
- **An engine patch reaches a player only as the staged file.** On Windows
  the launcher stages the overlay itself and `prepare-context.sh` never runs,
  so a patch under `overlays/playerbot/patches` is applied on this machine
  and nowhere else; and `patch` inside the image cannot be trusted either -
  the staged engine files carry mixed line endings and the core patch fails
  its own reverse check on them. What ships is the patched file itself,
  listed in `launcher/server-update-files.txt` next to the `playerbot_*`
  sources (`item_manager.cpp`, `config.cpp` for 0006). A new engine patch
  means: apply it to `linux-port/docker/game/src/server` with `patch -p1`,
  and add every file it touches to that list. 1.29.0 shipped without this and
  nobody got a chest.
- **The frontier is four maps and one table.** `GetPlayerBotFrontierArrival`,
  `GetPlayerBotFrontierExit` and `GetPlayerBotFrontierName` in
  `playerbot_types.h` answer for Orc Valley, the desert, Mount Sohan (61,
  `map_n_snowm_01`: the Infected of 49-58 in the south, ice creatures of
  62-66 in the north) and the Spider Dungeon V1 (104, spiders 50-58);
  `GetPlayerBotFrontierMapForLevel` routes by level and pid. V1 is reached
  across the desert: `TransitionPlayerBotMap` turns any warp into or out of
  104 into a warp onto 63 with the real destination kept in
  `lDesertCrossingTo`, and `ManagePlayerBotWorldTravel` walks the bot
  between the two gates (`PLAYERBOT_DESERT_V1_GATE_*`, the Bokjung gate)
  fighting nothing but a stone within `PLAYERBOT_CROSSING_STONE_RANGE`.
  **Map 43 is not
  Sohan** - `metin2_map_c3` is the second Jinno village with soldiers of
  26-36, and 1.29.0 to 1.29.6 sent the 26-39 band there under Sohan's name;
  the map index says nothing, read `map/index` and the regen before naming
  a map. 104 was moved onto the game1 core in `m2-render-config` - a bot
  cannot walk onto a map its own core does not host; 61 was there already.
  `apply.sh` keeps the list of maps a bot may stand on and sends the rest
  back to Bokjung at every start - add a map there too, or its bots walk
  home on the next restart. Adding a fifth map: a row in each helper, a hub table in
  `playerbot_wandering.h`, the navigation whitelist, the panel's bounds,
  names and tiles, and the core's MAP_ALLOW.
- **A mission is only as good as the map its monster stands on.** The
  level-up hunt (`PLAYERBOT_HUNTING_MISSIONS`, rows to 55) is driven by the
  engine's own `levelup` quest flags and its kill hook; the bot only picks
  the row and the option. Before the row was chosen by pid alone, and nearly
  every bot at forty was found holding a mission from fifteen with `remain`
  untouched, waiting for a wolf on a map it had left for good. Now
  `PLAYERBOT_HUNTING_MOB_HOMES` says where each monster stands (read out of
  the regen files - measure, do not guess), the option whose monster is on
  the bot's map wins, and a row is passed over without reward when it is
  outgrown by `PLAYERBOT_HUNTING_OUTGROWN_LEVELS`, has no hosted monster, or
  has hung for `PLAYERBOT_HUNTING_STALL_SECONDS`. The Biologist's chain has
  the same shape: the quest's kill hook drops the specimen only once the
  state says `go_to_disciple`, so the mission is taken wherever the bot
  stands (663 of 876 bots had never taken the mushroom mission because they
  passed level 25 outside Joan); only the hand-in walks to Joan.
  `GetActivePlayerBotBiologistMission` prefers what the bot already carries,
  then what stands on its map, then the first row undone. The Orc Tooth
  row has a second half, `key_item`, that waits for the Soul Stone; the
  state index of a compiled quest is a hash, not a position (see
  `quest/object/state/`), so never compare it with a small integer.
- **The three Monkey Dungeons are one maze, and a medal is a kill-group
  roll.** `metin2_map_monkey_dungeon_12`, `_2` and `_3` share one
  `server_attr`, the same regen cells and the same GOTO portals, so every
  place the easy dungeon was hard-coded is now a local offset from
  `GetPlayerBotMonkeyBase` and `IsPlayerBotMonkeyMap` names the three;
  `GetPlayerBotMonkeyMapForLevel` picks by band (18/33/46). The band is not
  taste: the medal is a `Type kill` group in `mob_drop_item.txt` and
  `CreateDropItem` multiplies every kill-group roll by `aiPercentByDeltaLev`,
  which is 1 at fifteen levels above the monster - a bot of forty-five in
  the easy dungeon got one medal per 140 trips. 109 was moved onto game1
  in `m2-render-config` like 104; `apply.sh` allows 108 and 109.
- **That maze is eleven chambers, and only the GOTO NPCs join them.** The nine
  rooms of `regen.txt` and the two boss rooms are separate connected
  components of the shared `server_attr`; `warp_npc_event` teleports any
  player within 300 units of a GOTO NPC, twice a second, so walking up to one
  is the whole crossing. Room choice used to ask
  `CPlayerBotNavigation::CanReach`, which only answers for the component the
  bot stands in, so every bot found one room - its own - and nine tenths of
  the dungeon was never walked: 130 trips in an hour and no planned crossing,
  every `PLAYERBOT_SPOT` density cell of all three dungeons in the entrance
  chamber. `PLAYERBOT_MONKEY_CHAMBERS` in `playerbot_movement.h` holds the
  eleven rooms as their spawn cells off the dungeon base, and
  `GetPlayerBotMonkeyChamberExits` gives the doors of one.
- **The three dungeons share the NPC cells and not the wiring.** The door at
  cell (80,308) leads to (106,547) on 25 and to (520,352) on 108, and 108/109
  carry two doors 25 does not have - which is how they reach the eleventh
  chamber. A table lifted from one map and used for the other two put bots in
  chambers nothing had planned. `GetPlayerBotMonkeyGeometry` therefore walks
  the map's sectrees once, takes every `IsGoto()` NPC, and reads its
  destination out of its own name exactly as `CHARACTER::StartWarpNPCEvent`
  does. Chamber and door components come off the navigation grid at the same
  time; `GetPlayerBotMonkeyChamberAt` asks at radius 1, because two chambers
  can run side by side with one blocked cell between them and a wide search
  answers with the corridor over the wall.
- **The crossing is noticed on the tick, not in the wander pass.**
  `UpdatePlayerBotMonkeyChamber` runs for every bot in a dungeon before
  anything can claim the tick. A portal moves the bot without touching its
  route, and re-planning towards the old destination finds the door it came
  in by; the wander pass runs only on a tick no subsystem took, and a bot
  dropped among aggressive monkeys is fighting, not wandering.
- **Whether a fight is worth having is one question with one answer.**
  `playerbot_combat_value_policy.h` decides it and nothing else does:
  `BuildPlayerBotCombatContext` is the only place a Context is built, and the
  three callers - the target collector, the multi-pull and
  `IsPlayerBotHeldTargetStillWorth` on a three-second clock - all go through
  it. Filtering only new candidates left the hole open: a monster picked up
  before the errand changed was fought to the end. The exceptions are
  countable (quest, material, stone, bounded defence) and each is bounded by
  something the engine can be asked about, not by intent: the material one by
  `PERCENT_LVDELTA` (a drop obeys the same level curve as experience, so a
  need is not a reason to farm what cannot drop it), the defence one by
  **one episode per bot** - keyed per attacker it was renewed for ever by two
  monsters taking turns, so it now ends only after
  `PLAYERBOT_DEFENCE_QUIET_TIME` without a combat action.
  **Self-defence is bounded by the leash and not by the clock**, and that
  distinction was learned the hard way: with a ten-second bound on it, nine
  strong monsters dropped next to a group of bots killed all of them, because
  after ten seconds each monster was refused as a target while it was still
  killing its bot. What the episode exists to stop is a bot being walked
  across a map by a chain of attackers, and `PLAYERBOT_DEFENCE_LEASH` stops
  exactly that; hitting back at what is hitting you is not a choice to
  ration. Helping a party member keeps the clock - defending yourself is
  compulsory in a way that helping is not - and RETREAT outranks both.
  The level cap has the same shape: `bTargetNeedsParty` decides what a bot
  walks up to, never what it answers, so a monster whose victim is this bot
  passes it.
  `PLAYERBOT_M2: census` is how this is measured: a count of level-40 bots in
  Bokjung says nothing, the reason each one is there says everything.
- **A Biologist hand-in is one specimen at a time, so the trip is too.** The
  walk to Joan was gated on carrying the whole remaining count - ten Orc Teeth
  at once - and the world had ten such bots against 700 carrying 2219 teeth
  between them, so the counter sat at 0/10 for everybody. The hand-in itself
  has always taken one specimen per interaction with a 60% accept roll;
  `PLAYERBOT_BIOLOGIST_MIN_HANDIN` is what the gate should have been, and the
  same threshold has to be used in `NeedsPlayerBotM1OnlyServices` or the trip
  from Bokjung never starts.
- **A shell holds what the engine says it holds.** `char_item.cpp` case 27987
  picks between two tables by `g_iUseLocale`: `{80,90,97}` when false and
  `{95,97,99}` when true. This world's `common.locale` is "english" and
  `__LocaleService_Init_English` sets the flag, so the live odds are 50% stone,
  45% nothing, 2/2/1 percent pearls - not the 10/7/3 the AI constants carried,
  which made opening one look four times better than it is. Check the flag
  before trusting `PLAYERBOT_SHELLFISH_*_PERMILLE`.
- **A skill book is not one commodity.** `PlayerBotSaleKey` was
  `vnum * 16 + refine`, and every ordinary book is vnum 50300 with the skill in
  socket 0 - so one cheap sale of a spare set the price of Aura Miecza, and a
  sale of Aura moved every other book. The key carries the skill now (seven
  bits, skills run 1..111) through the sale memory, the ask-step limiter and
  the asking price. Priors per named book and per pearl are the starting
  calibration; the sale memory blends them away as transactions arrive.
  `WantsPlayerBotStallItem` had no ITEM_SKILLBOOK branch at all, so no bot ever
  bought one - raising the price without that would only have made expensive
  unsold stalls.
- **`LimitPlayerBotAskStep` stepped on every call.** `1 + elapsed/interval`
  gives a full step at elapsed zero, and an accepted step resets the clock, so
  forty counters opening together moved the shared anchor forty times. Whole
  intervals only.
- **An arrival radius below `PLAYERBOT_NAV_ARRIVAL_DISTANCE` strands the bot.**
  `MovePlayerBot` reports success and stops moving a hundred units from its
  goal; a caller that keeps asking until twenty-five leaves the bot standing in
  the gap for ever, with `stuck=0` and nothing in any log - the walk did
  succeed, by its own rule. Cutting `PLAYERBOT_FISHING_ARRIVE` to twenty-five
  for the sake of spacing anglers froze most of them: forty-three at the water
  and eleven fishing, two of them measured stuck at seventy-one and seventy-six
  units from a destination neither reached. Back at a hundred it is fifty-three
  and fifty-three. The rule is a `static_assert` in `playerbot_activities.h`
  now, because this is the third shape the same mistake has taken - the goal
  snap for the town leg, the goal snap for the portal walk, and now the arrival
  test itself - and a comment has stopped three times being enough.
- **The planner and the walk have to agree about the same segment.**
  A* strings its corners straight between cell centres on the static grid;
  `SegmentClearWorld` runs a supercover traversal from the character's exact
  interpolated position and counts a cell grazed by a millimetre of corner.
  Where they disagree the walk refuses the waypoint, `MovePlayerBot` throws the
  route away and replans two hundred milliseconds later - identically, for
  ever. A portal destination is a raw constant sitting on a cell boundary, so
  every portal in the world had this: measured at five of them on four maps,
  forty-two refusals in twenty seconds with no movement and **nothing in any
  log**, because that branch logged nothing and the unreachable branch beside
  it speaks at failures one and three and then goes quiet. The walk aims at the
  destination's cell centre now (thirty-five units at most, against a switch
  distance of two hundred), a refused segment gets two rescues before the route
  is dropped, and the branch says so. Stalls went from ninety a minute to none
  and 569 transitions ran in eight minutes; the tick fell from 9.5 s to 4.4.
  When a diagnosis needs three deploys to find, record the outcome
  (`bLastNavOutcome`) rather than deducing it - every way this function can
  decline looks identical from outside.
- **Progress towards a portal is a waypoint consumed, not a shorter straight
  line.** A portal stands against scenery far more often than in open ground,
  so walking round a building is the normal case; measuring only the straight
  line threw a bot at route 5/7 off its route every twenty seconds. And the
  stall clock is wall time, which runs while the bot is fighting or shopping -
  `PLAYERBOT_PORTAL_WALK_MIN_TICKS` makes it count attempts, after one bot was
  caught being declared stalled on its first walk step with 88 km to go.
- **Being tracked by Git is not being delivered.** An install assembled from an
  update package holds exactly what `server-update-files.txt` lists;
  `panel/bin/apply_rates.sh` was tracked and still missing on the machine that
  reported it, and `game/rates/` was the next one along - "failed to compute
  cache key ... /rates: not found", unrepairable by reinstalling because the
  reinstall uses the same package. Six build inputs were missing across the
  contexts. `tools/check-update-covers-build.py` reads every `COPY` of every
  Dockerfile and fails when one of them would not arrive; run it before a
  release rather than trusting this list to stay complete.
- **The spawn queue was filled once and never looked at again.**
  `SpawnRegistered` queues the cohort at startup and drains it over
  `PLAYERBOT_SPAWN_WINDOW`; nothing counted the world afterwards, so a bot whose
  load failed or which left later was gone until a restart. Reported as "a
  thousand asked for, six hundred and fifty arrived, three hundred and fifty an
  hour later". `TopUpMissingBots` re-counts once a minute against
  `CHARACTER_MANAGER::FindByPID` and re-queues the missing through the same
  staggered path, bounded by the original window so it restores the cohort and
  never grows it. On a healthy server eleven of eight hundred and fifty were
  missing from the first fill.
- **A conjunction that rejects tells nobody which clause did it.**
  `LoadRegisteredBots` accepts an identity only when six conditions hold at
  once, and printed one number. `ReportPlayerBotRegistryShortfall` runs the same
  joins with conditional sums and says which clause dropped what: on this world
  `rows=1182 usable=1012 login=170 social_id=101 other_characters=62`, so the
  ceiling is accounts whose login or social id does not match the generator's
  pattern - not the launcher's slider.
- **The desert was the richest map in the world and nobody hunted on it.**
  14026 spawn points against Orc Valley's 8122, levels 37 to 51 across its own
  bands, and `PLAYERBOT_DESERT_MAX_LEVEL` capped it at 36 - so everyone from
  thirty-six up went to the valley and the desert was a corridor to the Spider
  Dungeon. Raising the cap to 47 and splitting the band moved Orc Valley from
  308-388 bots to 141 and the desert from 97-123 to 232, and cut the tick from
  13-19 s of every 60 to 5.2: spreading the population over more maps is worth
  more than any navigation tuning done so far.
- **An engine patch is only tested where prepare-context.sh runs, and that is
  never Windows.** `0008-warp-npc-ignores-playerbots.patch` shipped truncated
  from 1.30.13 to 1.30.20: the header said `@@ -6447,7 +6447,19 @@` and the body
  carried six old and eighteen new lines, one context line short of the closing
  brace. Every Linux and VPS install stopped at "Hunk #1 FAILED" and could not
  update; no Windows install noticed, because there the launcher stages the
  already-patched `char.cpp` and the patch is never applied. Dry-run every patch
  with `--fuzz=0` against `m2src-cache/tree/port40250/server` before shipping it -
  the note above this one already said so, and this is what skipping it costs.
- **Every build context a player builds has to ship, not just the game's.**
  `docker compose up` bakes game, panel and seban-panel together, so a
  two-byte `linux-port/docker/panel/Dockerfile` failed the whole bake and the
  other two were CANCELED with it: nothing started, and "click PLAY again"
  could not help because no update replaced the broken file - only
  `game/Dockerfile` was in `server-update-files.txt`. All seven are now, with
  their `.dockerignore` files.
- **The point you verified must be the point the engine samples.** The
  navigation grid calls a cell blocked by testing its centre,
  `base + n * PLAYERBOT_NAV_CELL + PLAYERBOT_NAV_CELL / 2`. Fishing stands
  generated on the multiples of fifty sit on cell corners, so server_attr said
  "standable" about one point and the grid judged a different one; the walk then
  snapped them - with a twelve-cell radius against an arrival radius of
  twenty-five - and two anglers ended up eight units apart on one stand. Both
  halves are the same lesson as the portal walk: generate on cell centres, and
  keep the snap inside the radius that tests arrival.
- **A plan budget counted in plans starves the plans that matter.** Measured
  over a minute at 839 bots: 7440 route plans, of which 7086 were sub-64-cell
  hops to the next monster costing 41 milliseconds between them, while 148 long
  ones cost eleven of the twelve seconds. Every one of them charged the same
  slot against `PLAYERBOT_NAV_MAX_HEAVY_PLANS_PER_TICK`, so the hops filled the
  tick and the crossings - the walk to a portal, the trip to a merchant - were
  refused: half of all requests deferred and one waiting thirteen minutes.
  `PLAYERBOT_NAV_PLAN_COST` charges by distance bucket and a hop is free;
  `PLAYERBOT_NAV_STARVED_ATTEMPTS` lets a request that has been turned away that
  many times past the count, still bounded by the microsecond budget and the
  far-plan minute. Deferrals fell to 264 a minute and starvation to none.
- **A pass that yields the tick must not leave something for the next pass to
  claim.** `MovePlayerBotToWorldPortal` returns false after
  `PLAYERBOT_PORTAL_WALK_TIMEOUT` so the bot falls through to wandering and
  plans afresh from somewhere else. The manager's "a transport horse must not
  fight" dismount took that tick instead - it dismounts and `continue`s - so the
  bot spent its escape getting off the horse and remounted on the next travel
  pass. Forty-six bots at the Sohan exit, mounting and dismounting every twenty
  seconds without a step. The walk dismounts itself before yielding.
- **A snapped goal must stay inside the radius that tests arrival - the portal
  walk too.** It asked for a 24-cell snap (1200 world units) against
  `PLAYERBOT_PORTAL_SWITCH_DISTANCE` of 200, so a route could end a kilometre
  short and the transition never fired. `PLAYERBOT_PORTAL_SNAP_CELLS` derives
  the snap from the switch distance instead. `MovePlayerBotTownLeg` sprang this
  first; anything that walks to a point and then tests a small radius around it
  is the same shape.
- **The shop pass judges an item before the equipment pass does.**
  `ManagePlayerBotPrivateShop` runs near the top of the tick and
  `ManagePlayerBotEquipment` near the bottom, and the stall treated any weapon
  or armour whose slot was already filled as a spare - which a gift is not: it
  beats a full slot rather than filling an empty one, and a spare at +6 or
  better is the highest-scoring thing a counter can carry.
  `IsPlayerBotWearableUpgrade` asks the engine's own `CanEquipNow` and the
  equipment pass's own score, so the race stops mattering. The line is "can wear
  it now": a level-30 weapon in a level-5 bag stays goods.
- **A fast build that ships only the core ships a different server.**
  `tools/fast-game-build` swapped the compiled binary into whatever the last
  full build left behind, so the test server ran month-old container scripts
  without saying so: an `m2-render-config` from before the Spider Dungeon and
  the hard Monkey Dungeon moved onto game1, a `MAP_ALLOW` without them, and
  every bot that reached either gate refused by `TransitionPlayerBotMap` ten
  thousand times a minute - one throttled log line a minute with the real count
  hidden in its `[+N more]`. A day of measurements concluded those maps were
  empty for reasons that were never true. The fast build copies
  `linux-port/docker/game/bin/` now, exactly as the real image does.
- **A price of one yang is permanent.** `GetPlayerBotNpcSellUnitPrice` returns
  zero for anything `item_proto` prices at zero - the horse medal 50050, every
  chest and casket - so the asking price came out `max(1, 0 * markup)`, and the
  median wallet is zero until `RefreshPlayerBotMarketLedger` has run for the
  first time, which removes the only other floor. `LimitPlayerBotAskStep` then
  made it permanent: five percent of one yang is zero in integer arithmetic, so
  no anchor under four could ever move, and every stall listing the item
  refreshed the clock before the hour of staleness could run out. Three things
  hold it now - a prior for the goods with no merchant price, an anchor under
  `PLAYERBOT_MARKET_ASK_FLOOR` treated as an accident rather than a price, and a
  step of at least one yang per whole interval.
- **A pass that refuses must also back off.** The private shop returned without
  setting `dwNextShopKeepTime` when the bag had no cell for the shop bundle, so
  it asked again on the next tick: eight log lines a second for one bot, and the
  bot pacing its pitch for ever - because the pass that would have emptied the
  bag is the merchant leg of the town visit, and this one kept claiming the
  tick ahead of it.
- **The Biologist's seven rows are seven quests, not one chain.** Picking "the
  first row left undone" as the fallback handed a bot of forty-two in Orc Valley
  the Gango Root of level fifteen, whose monster stands in Joan; it never goes
  there, so the panel read "Korzen Gango 0/5" while the bot hit Orcs, for ever.
  A row outgrown by `PLAYERBOT_BIOLOGIST_OUTGROWN_LEVELS` is stepped over by
  both middle passes - including "its monster is on this map", or a hand-in trip
  to Joan would leave a bot of forty camped on level-fifteen ground - and when
  every row is outgrown the highest one left is taken instead of none.
- **The advanced panel's restart console wrote to a name nobody reads.**
  `queue_server_settings` published `server-settings.request`; the game
  container watches `request` and only `request` (see `m2-rates`). Nothing
  deleted the orphan either, so the exclusive `os.link` that guarded against
  double clicks refused every click after the first one, permanently. Both
  buttons now go through `queue_rate_restart`, which is the path the rates page
  has always used, and the double-click guard is a bounded look at
  `rates.status` instead of a lock nothing releases. The map respawn half of
  that console still has no consumer in this image and the panel now says so.
- **An unfinished errand is somebody's job until it is done.** The 8 September
  audit traced the loop that kept level-40 bots fighting in Bokjung, and it is
  not the map choice: the bot needs a merchant, the route is deferred for want
  of planning budget, the inactivity watchdog fires on the stillness, the visit
  is thrown away, and one second later the bot casts an attack skill at
  whatever is nearby with the need it came for still unmet. The watchdog still
  clears the dead route - that is what it is for - but `bServicePending` now
  carries the errand across the reset with its own retry, and the combat
  adapter puts such a bot in COMMITTED_TRAVEL so the reset cannot hand an unmet
  need to the target picker. It gives up loudly after
  `PLAYERBOT_SERVICE_GIVE_UP` rather than wedging.
- **"Is this fight worth it" and "may I grind here at all" are two rules.**
  The combat value policy answers the first; `IsPlayerBotGrindAllowedHere`
  answers the second, and above `PLAYERBOT_M2_COHORT_MAX_LEVEL` in Bokjung the
  answer is no. That needed a fourth mode in the policy - `SERVICE_ONLY`,
  placed after the named objectives and before the experience checks, because
  `COMMITTED_TRAVEL` refuses everything including the quest the bot is
  legitimately there for. The rule has to cover every road to a fight, not just
  the collector: party focus, the held target, the engaged target, the
  multi-pull and the Archer's lure all ask it. Self-defence never does.
- **A departure intent outlives the errand that delays it.**
  `lDepartureMap`/`dwDepartureSince` are set when travel is held back by a
  purchase and are not cleared by the watchdog, so after the visit the bot
  leaves instead of waiting for ambition to be rolled again.
- **A deferral is not an unreachable destination.** Three budgets -
  plans per tick, planning time per tick, far plans per minute - returned the
  same `PLAYERBOT_NAV_PLAN_DEFERRED`, and the log could not tell them apart.
  `s_szPlayerBotNavDeferReason` and `dwFirstNavDeferTime` put the reason and the
  wait into the line. The fair queue with per-request ageing that the audit also
  asked for is *not* built: it is a hot-path redesign and belongs in its own
  measured change.
- **A buff cast claims the tick, so the set has to be gathered quickly.**
  `ManagePlayerBotCombatBuffs` casts one buff and returns; at five seconds
  between passes a Warrior needed ten seconds for aura and berserk and a
  weapon Sura fifteen for three enchantments. Aura of the Sword lasts
  `30+50*k` seconds on a `30+10*k` cooldown, so a bot was spending as long
  putting it back up as it stayed up, and was usually seen without it.
  `PLAYERBOT_BUFF_RECHECK_FAST` brings the bot straight back after a cast;
  the ordinary five seconds resume on the first pass that finds nothing
  missing. Mana is the other half and is not solved here: 213 bots of 1300
  hold less than the 300 SP a mastered aura costs.
- **A splash skill is the weakest thing in the rotation against one target.**
  `IsPlayerBotSplashSkill` asks the engine for `SKILL_FLAG_SPLASH` and the
  rotation skips those against a Metin stone, which is never a crowd. The
  rotation takes the first skill off cooldown, and a stone lasts long enough
  to put the good ones there, so what actually landed on stones was Poison
  Cloud - `-(lv*2 + (atk + str*3 + dex*18)*k)` against Fast Attack's
  `-(atk + (1.6*atk + ...))`, for the same animation lock.
- **The wallet floor cannot rank two materials; the merchant's price can.**
  `GetPlayerBotShopAskingPrice` raises a material to a share of the median
  wallet, and that share was the same number for everything - ~38 000 at a
  2.6M median - so a shellfish (merchant 3 000) and a white pearl (12 000)
  stood on the counters at the same price. It is scaled by `npcUnit` against
  `PLAYERBOT_MARKET_WALLET_REFERENCE_PRICE`, in hundredths and clamped to
  [100, 800] percent so nothing gets cheaper and nothing runs away. And
  `PLAYERBOT_MARKET_REGULATOR_MAX` went from 1.35 to 2.0: a third above the
  prior is not a market answering five hundred bots short of a thing no
  counter carries.
- **A keeper trades in the town it is standing in.** The stall used to roll
  a town and then refuse to open unless the bot was already there - nine
  rolls in ten chose Joan while the bots with goods stood in Bokjung, so Joan
  got no stalls at all. The market browse has always read the ring of its own
  bot's map, so a stall opens where its customers are.
- **`player.map_index` is where a bot was last saved, not where one is.**
  The table holds every registered bot, and most of them are not spawned: it
  said four hundred bots on map 21 while `playerbot_status.tsv` - which only
  carries live characters - said nineteen of eight hundred and thirty-seven.
  A conclusion about where the population is must come from the status file
  or the core, never from a count over `player`. Joan is thin because the
  live cohort is mostly level 40+, and everyone past the M2 band leaves for
  the frontier; what actually takes a bot there is fishing, whose bank, bait
  merchant and market ring are all on that one map.
- **A boss is news, and the news travels through a guild.** A boss hub scored
  `PLAYERBOT_RAID_WORTH` for everybody, which outran every hunting ground by
  two orders of magnitude, so a whole level band walked to one monster - 145
  of them in two minutes - and the ones that arrived late stood about. Worse,
  the chosen hub was kept for `PLAYERBOT_HUB_STICK_TIME` **without asking
  again whether the boss was still standing**, so four minutes of a column of
  bots on empty ground was the normal end of every raid. The stick now
  re-asks (`boss down, going back to work`), the first bot to find him
  standing calls its own guild through `CGuild::Chat`, and that guild may
  fill `PLAYERBOT_RAID_CROWD` places while everyone else gets half of them.
  Count the bots that have *decided* to go, not the ones standing on the hub:
  `CountPlayerBotRaiders` keeps a roster per race, because a hundred bots
  choosing in the same second all see an empty hub and all set off.
- **A pull is what came back, not what was shot at.** `playerbot_lure.h` is
  the Archer's party role as a whole errand - PLAN, APPROACH, TAG, CONFIRM,
  RETURN, HANDOFF, RECOVER - and CONFIRM counts the live monsters actually
  chasing the bot, so a miss, a one-shot kill and a pack that never woke up
  all count as nothing. It reuses the ordinary bow shot
  (`ExecutePlayerBotBasicAttack`, which owns range, arrows and rhythm) rather
  than growing a second damage path; the old `ExecutePlayerBotArcherLuring`
  had one, complete with an invented damage number when the real one came out
  under five. Two things it must not do: hold a character pointer across
  ticks (the roster is copied out of the party every tick, and the claim on
  the role is keyed by leader PID), and let the party follow it - the lurer
  keeps `dwTargetVID` at zero so the shared party focus never sees the pack it
  is waking up. The multi-pull cannot run at the same time by construction:
  that one refuses a bot in a party and this one needs five.
  `FindPlayerBotLurePack` is its own finder for a reason - the multi-pull's
  looks for what is at a solo bot's feet, and on a map carrying eight hundred
  bots that describes the ground the party is already standing on.
- **A bot cannot be warped by a warp NPC, and now it is not asked to be.**
  `WarpSet` tells the client to reconnect to whichever core hosts the target
  map; a bot descriptor has nobody to answer that, so the map change is made
  server-side instead. It used to be made 900 units short of the portal,
  which is what a player sees as a bot vanishing out of clear ground. Patch
  0008 makes `warp_npc_event` skip a character whose descriptor `IsBot()` -
  only in the `m_bUseWarp` branch, because the GOTO branch below it is a
  local `Show()` and the Monkey Dungeon is walked with it - so the margin
  only has to cover a tick of running: `PLAYERBOT_PORTAL_SWITCH_DISTANCE`.
  `char.cpp` had to join `server-update-files.txt` for that, which also
  delivers patch 0004 to players for the first time.
- **One box the engine will not open stopped every other.**
  `ManagePlayerBotChests` returned false on a failed `UseItem`, so the first
  giftbox in the bag that cannot be opened - 50192 and 50193, six thousand
  refusals a minute between them - hid every Moonlight chest behind it: 587
  bots holding 9723 of them, stacks of 106, 190 opened in an hour, and bags
  only 29 cells of 90 full. A refusal now skips that box, is remembered by
  vnum for `PLAYERBOT_CHEST_REFUSED_RETRY`, and says so in the log; the pass
  also moved up into the upkeep group, because at the bottom of the tick it
  sat behind five subsystems that each claim the tick. The backlog cleared to
  887 in eight minutes.
- **A price keyed by vnum and refine cannot tell two pieces apart.**
  `GetPlayerBotShopAskingPrice` ran on the merchant table, the sale memory and
  `LimitPlayerBotAskStep` - all three keyed by that pair - so boots +7 with
  five bonus lines and boots +7 with none both asked 150 000.
  `GetPlayerBotBonusPricePercent` in `playerbot_bonus.h` adds a percentage for
  the lines and for the rolls a player stops on, and it has to be applied to
  every way out of that function: the flat +7/+8/+9 prices return early, and
  those are exactly the items people look at.
- **A launcher check must read the answer, not the exit code.** `docker info
  --format "{{.ServerVersion}}"` exits 0 while printing "Error response from
  daemon: Docker Desktop is unable to start" where the version belongs, and
  `Invoke-M2DiagnosticProcess` concatenates stderr into Output. The check
  reported that as "OK: Docker Engine odpowiada (wersja Error response...)",
  which also suppressed the WSL remedy - it is only raised when the engine is
  known to be down. A version is digits and dots.
- **The third hand is 72018, and the group is what the engine reads.**
  `CHARACTER::RewardGold` gives a kill's yang straight to the killer when
  `IsEquipUniqueGroup(UNIQUE_GROUP_AUTOLOOT)`, and what group 10011 holds in
  these serverfiles is 72016..72018 - not the 71010 an item shop sells, which
  is in no group at all and would do nothing. It is a timed item:
  `ITEM_MANAGER::CreateItem` seeds `ITEM_SOCKET_UNIQUE_REMAIN_TIME` from
  VALUE0 (180 for 72018) and `unique_expire_event` counts it down one minute
  per minute of wear, so `ManagePlayerBotThirdHand` winds it back up rather
  than buying another. That pass must not put the winding behind its own
  `EquipItem`: the engine refuses to equip within 1.5 s of an attack or a
  cast, which is most of a bot's life - the first draft wound eight clocks
  out of six hundred, and the ordinary equipment pass had put the rest on.
- **A snapped goal must stay inside the radius that tests arrival.**
  `MovePlayerBotTownLeg` asked for a sixteen-cell target snap and then
  checked arrival at 350 to 850 units. A goal behind a counter snapped
  further than the check, so the bot walked its route, arrived at nothing,
  cleared the route and planned the same one - and consuming a waypoint
  resets `bStuckCounter`, so the six-failure service rescue never fired.
  One bot stood at the Joan skill trainer for three days, reset by the
  inactivity watchdog every 90 s without taking a step. The snap is now a
  tenth of the arrival distance in cells.
- **Droppers are personalities, not roles.** `IsPlayerBotDropper` names the
  four; `GetPlayerBotPersonalityByPID` is how a rule that only has a
  character asks. The travel gates (`ShouldPlayerBotVisitM3`,
  `ShouldPlayerBotHuntM2Bestials`, `ShouldPlayerBotPursueHorseExpedition`)
  answer for them by level alone, the stall treats them as keepers, and the
  Metin dropper's books are never junk. Appending to the personality enum is
  safe; inserting shifts every id in the panel's status file.
- **A route a fight interrupts is parked, not dropped.** `ClearPlayerBotRoute`
  keeps a route with `PLAYERBOT_NAV_PARK_MIN_WAYPOINTS` left in
  `vecParkedRoute`, and `MovePlayerBot` takes it up again from the nearest
  waypoint the bot can walk straight to when the same destination is asked
  for on the same map. Before this a valley crossing to a hub 70 km away was
  planned from scratch after every fight along the way - a far plan costs
  150-250 ms, and there were 100-170 of them a minute, 20-29 s of every 60.
  `PLAYERBOT_LOAD` reports `resumed=`; `PLAYERBOT_NAV: far plan` names the
  destination of every plan over 1024 cells, which is how the pattern was
  found (the same hub from the same few hundred metres, every two seconds).
- **Measure before tuning a budget.** `CPlayerBotManager::Update` logs
  `PLAYERBOT_LOAD:` once a minute: tick time, plans by distance bucket with
  their cost, deferrals, target searches, snapshot, map scans, saves, watchdog
  resets. CPU alone said "A*" once and the fix put every bot's map scan in the
  same second; the line says which plans, and how many milliseconds each.

- **The market is a ledger, not a shelf.** `RefreshPlayerBotMarketLedger`
  (`playerbot_market.h`, once a minute from the tick) counts the units on
  every open counter and the bots short of each material with money to buy
  it. `DecidePlayerBotMaterialListing` in `playerbot_town.h` lists a
  material only while supply is under 1.5 x 5 x demand, allows one probe
  stack when nobody is short, and logs `PLAYERBOT_MARKET: held ... reason=`
  for the rest. `GetPlayerBotShopAskingPrice` blends the prior with the
  sale median by n/(n+4) in log space, applies ((D+5)/(S+5))^0.2 within
  [0.75, 1.35] for materials, and `LimitPlayerBotAskStep` lets a price move
  five percent per ten minutes. The prior is the merchant's price times
  three or a share of the median shopping wallet, whichever is more -
  the merchant pays pennies and the bots hold millions. `PLAYERBOT_MARKET:
  ledger` every ten minutes is the report. A human buying from a counter
  is invisible to all of it: the purchase goes through CShopManager and
  never reaches this code.
- **A counter line is a grid slot and an item id, not an index and a vnum.**
  `CShop::SetShopItems` lays a private shop out on a five-column grid by
  item height (a weapon is three cells, an armour two) and silently drops a
  line whose `display_pos` is already covered ("not empty position" in
  syserr); `CShopManager::Buy` indexes by that position. Numbering the
  lines 0, 1, 2 lost every second-row line under a weapon, and buyers were
  refused at empty slots with a hacker log line: 2158 refusals to 501
  purchases in one hour. `FindPlayerBotShopSlot` places lines the way
  `CGrid::FindBlank` does and `TPlayerBotShopOffer::bSlot` carries the
  result; `dwItemID` and `FindPlayerBotOfferItem` (the item exists and the
  keeper still owns it - the engine's own test) say whether the line is
  still for sale, because a sold stack's vnum is often still in the bag as
  a second stack. The buyer re-reads the counter on the tick it arrives,
  whatever the browse clock says.

- **A book is read whenever there is one, unless the panel says otherwise.**
  The engine puts SKILLBOOK_DELAY_MIN..MAX (eighteen to thirty hours)
  between two reads of one skill; `ManagePlayerBotSkillBooks` waves that
  away with `SetSkillNextReadTime` while the `BOOKS` key in the weights file
  is on (the default), and imposes no wait of its own.
  What still paces a skill is `CHARACTER::LearnSkillByBook` and is not ours:
  20 000 experience taken per read, a roll on each one, and a number of
  successful reads per master level. Nor is the wait what limits it in
  practice - of 480 bots with a skill at Master, 326 carry books and 44
  carry a book of that skill, so the supply of the right book is the
  bottleneck and always was. A bot keeps
  `PLAYERBOT_BOOK_KEEP_PER_SKILL` books of each own skill and the rest are
  goods; a keyless treasure chest is junk once the bag is down to
  `PLAYERBOT_BAG_PRESSURE_FREE_CELLS`. The Moonlight chest opens by itself
  but only into a free cell, which is what a bag full of books and chests
  had stopped.
- **The chat reaches the bots through patch 0007, and only there.**
  `CInputMain::Chat` hands a player's shout to
  `CPlayerBotManager::OnPlayerShout` after `SendShout`, and
  `CInputMain::Whisper` hands a whisper addressed to a bot to
  `OnPlayerWhisper` instead of a descriptor with no client; `shop.h` gets
  `GetItemVector()` so a bot can read a player's counter and buy from it
  (capped at `PLAYERBOT_MARKET_STACK_WALLET_PERCENT` of the median wallet
  per line). The staged `input_main.cpp` and `shop.h` ship in
  `server-update-files.txt` like 0006's files. A bot's own shouts go out
  through `SendShout` directly and never come back through the hook. Text
  is CP1250; `FoldPlayerBotChatText` is how names are compared.

- **Hunting stones is a state, not only a role.** `IsPlayerBotMetinHunting`
  in `playerbot_types.h` is what the planner, the target scoring and the
  wandering ask; it is true for the hunter role for life and for any other
  bot during a Metin expedition (`RollPlayerBotMetinExpedition` in
  `playerbot_planner.h`: an hourly roll, `PLAYERBOT_METIN_EXPEDITION_*`, the
  METIN weight scales the chance). A rule that tests `bBotRole ==
  BOT_ROLE_METIN_HUNTER` directly is a rule the expedition does not reach.

## Engine facts worth not re-deriving

- Item types/subtypes live in `common/item_length.h`; map attributes and
  `SECTREE_SIZE`/`CELL_SIZE` in `game/src/sectree.h`.
- Map world coordinates: `world = BasePosition + cell * 100`, with `BasePosition`
  from the map's `Setting.txt` and `cell` from `npc.txt`. Map 21 is `metin2_map_b1`.
- `server_attr` is per-sector lzo1x: `int32 width, height`, then per sector a
  `uint32` size and a block expanding to 128×128 `uint32` attributes, one per
  50 world units. `ATTR_BLOCK = 1<<0`, `ATTR_WATER = 1<<1`. Decoder and a terrain
  dump: `tools/decode_server_attr.py`.
- **`ATTR_WATER` is terrain, not a wall.** The engine tests it in exactly one
  place -- whether there is water in front of a fishing rod -- and never for
  movement. A river carries `BLOCK|WATER`; a bridge deck or a ford carries
  `WATER` with the block bit cleared, and that is how a map says "cross here".
  Orc Valley is 23 islands joined by 22 such crossings, so the navigation
  treating water as blocking left every bot on the island the entrance opens
  onto: 17.6% of the walkable ground, 161 of 532 spawn groups. It blocks on
  `ATTR_BLOCK|ATTR_OBJECT` and charges `PLAYERBOT_NAV_WATER_PENALTY` per wet
  cell instead, so a bridge is used and the desert shallows are walked round.
  `tools/analyse_map_bridges.py` measures this for any map.
- **Reading a spawn file: `group.txt` and `group_group.txt` are not the same
  shape.** In `group.txt` a member line is `<idx> "<name>" <mob vnum>` and the
  mob is the **last** field; in `group_group.txt` it is `<idx> <group vnum>
  <probability>` and the group is the **middle** one. Taking the last field of
  both - which reads a probability as a group id - makes every `r` line in every
  regen.txt resolve to nothing, and the map then looks empty. It is not: Orc
  Valley alone has 4041 spawn points over 32 mob types. A regen line's type is
  its first field, `m`/`b`/`e` naming a mob directly, `g` a group, `r` a
  group_group; the id is the last field of that line.
- **Where the refine materials come from.** The 407 recipes in
  `player.refine_proto` name 84 distinct materials; 64 of them drop from a
  monster that stands on one of the fourteen hosted maps (`mob_proto` column 33
  through `etc_drop_item.txt`, or `mob_drop_item.txt`), and the fishbone comes
  from gutting a fish, which no drop table records. Orc Valley alone carries
  ten - the Orc Amulet from Elite Orc (631) and Big Bald Orc (651), the
  Esoteric Guide from 701/751, Orc Tooth, Snake Tail, Curse Book - and the Bear
  Hide that 943 pieces of +6 gear were waiting on comes from ordinary bears on
  maps 21 and 24. What was in shortage was never the drop; it was the killing:
  bots warped in at one point and never left it, and a spare material was
  vendored on the next town visit. An earlier version of this note said 28 of
  84 were obtainable. That number came from the broken group_group parser
  described above; measure again before believing any count of this kind.
- Drop tables answer three different questions and only one of them uses vnums.
  `mob_drop_item.txt` is per-mob and by vnum; `etc_drop_item.txt` and
  `common_drop_item.txt` key on the **Korean item name**, and the etc table is
  reached through `mob_proto` column 33 (`DROP_ITEM`), one designated item per
  mob. Grepping a vnum finds nothing in two of the three. The chance is
  `prob * 10000 * PERCENT_LVDELTA * rate / 100` against `number(1, 4000000)` -
  and the `PRIV_ITEM_DROP` term in `GetDropPct` is defeated by an operator
  precedence bug in the engine, so it never applies.
- Shellfish (27987) and the three pearls (27992-27994) are hardcoded in
  `fishing.cpp` and `char_item.cpp`, not in `fishing.txt`. They carry 26 and 14
  recipes respectively, so fishing is the only route past the high refines.
- **The rest of the fishing chain, as the engine does it.** A live fish
  used (`fishing::UseFish`) becomes a dead fish, a bone, a shellfish or
  nothing. A dead fish is grilled by handing it to a campfire: Dried Wood
  (27600, the Fisherman's shop, 20 000 yang) used once spawns mob 12000 for
  forty seconds, `CHARACTER::GiveItem(campfire, cell)` runs `fishing::Grill`
  and the grilled fish (27863-27883) comes back - potions of 180/350/230 HP,
  180/500 SP, a Carp for movement speed and a Rudd for dexterity
  (USE_ABILITY_UP). A shellfish (27987, `char_item.cpp` case 27987) holds a
  Stone Piece half the time, nothing 30%, then a white, blue or blood pearl
  at 10/7/3% - so opening one is a bet the bot weighs against selling it
  whole, and the population counts every outcome including the empty ones
  (`PLAYERBOT_SHELLFISH:` every ten minutes).
- Fishing: the rod goes in `WEAR_WEAPON`; bait is **not** consumed from the pouch
  but written into the rod's socket 2 by using a bait item. A cast bites after
  10–40 s and then leaves a 6 s window; `fishing::Compute` peaks ~3 s after the
  bite. Calling `fishing()` while a cast is live is the same as pulling.

## `PLAYERBOTS_FEATURE_SPECS.md`

Design intent, not a reference. It was written independently of the code and its
constants are frequently wrong — verify every VNUM, distance and API call against
the engine before using it. Modules 2 and 3 in it are already implemented, and
implemented differently from what it describes.

## Conventions

- Comments explain *why*, in English, in the voice of the surrounding code.
  Prefer explaining the constraint that forced the shape over restating the code.
- Log with the `PLAYERBOT_<AREA>:` prefix and include `pid=` and `name=`.
- Player-visible bot strings are Polish, ASCII-only (no diacritics).
- Tune with named constants at the top of the namespace, not inline literals.
- Commit messages are lowercase `type(scope): summary` in the imperative.


## Recent Session History & Unpushed State (2026-09-03)

- **Unpushed Commits (2 ahead of origin/main):**
  * 4812874: eat(playerbot): open the stalls, announce good refines, learn what lives on each map
  * d9fc647: ix(playerbot): let a parked keeper reopen its stall after a restart
- **Engine Patches:**
  * Added patch for char.cpp replacing GetPart(PART_MAIN) > 2 with IsPolymorphed(), registered in context build.
- **Stalls / Stragany Verification:**
  * Tested live with 350 running bots: 14-33 stalls active around the market in Bokjung with zero rejections, and successfully recover after server/container restarts.
- **Next Roadmap Priorities:**
  * From PLAYERBOTS_FEATURE_SPECS.md: Module 2 (Mounted combat tuning against Metin stones), Module 4 (Bot guilds and guild marks), Module 5 (Live AI Config sliders in admin panel without recompilation), Module 6 (Weekly season analytics).
